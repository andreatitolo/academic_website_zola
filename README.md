# Personal academic website

Source code for my academic website built with [Zola](https://getzola.org) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) at [andreatitolo.com](https://andreatitolo.com).
This is a new version of the site, previously built with the [Academic theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), which can still be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/andreatitolo/andreatitolo_web).
