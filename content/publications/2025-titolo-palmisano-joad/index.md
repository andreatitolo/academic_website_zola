abstract = "The present dataset contains point geometries of archaeological sites (5,542) in the South Levant. Data were collected from different sources: published archaeological surveys, online databases, excavation reports, and stored in a geospatial database in an open format – geopackage (.gpkg). It comprises information about periods of occupation (site-phase), location, estimated size, typology, and bibliographical information. The dataset is stored on GitHub and Zenodo under an open-access license. For the South Levant, it represents – to our knowledge – the first dataset combining location accuracy, estimated size, and an analysis-ready structure. It can support a wide range of analyses, from simple point pattern to long-term settlement history reconstruction, to multi-proxy studies if combined with other archaeological and paleoenvironmental data."
