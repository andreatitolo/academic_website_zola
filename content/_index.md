I am a researcher at the [University of Bologna](https://unibo.it) (South Western Asia Archaeology). My research interests include Settlement Pattern Analysis, Quantitative and Computational Archaeology, Remote Sensing, GIS, and mapping. 
I am currently part of the [INRES project](https://dse.unibo.it/en/research/research-projects/national-projects-1/project-inres) as PostDoctoral Researcher and [ReLand project](https://www.unipa.it/dipartimenti/cultureesocieta/Missioni-Archeologiche/Missioni-allestero/ReLand/) as Field Director.

During my Ph.D. I analyzed Iron Age settlement patterns along the Euphrates river in ancient Mesopotamia. I used a landscape archaeology approach, also integrating geomorphology, remote sensing, quantitative and spatial analyses.
