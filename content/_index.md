I am a researcher at the University of Turin (South Western Asia Archaeology). My research interests include Settlement Pattern Analysis, Remote Sensing, GIS, and mapping

During my Ph.D. I analyzed Iron Age settlement patterns along the Euphrates river in ancient Mesopotamia. I used a landscape archaeology approach, also integrating geomorphology, remote sensing, quantitative and spatial analyses.
