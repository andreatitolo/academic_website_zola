I am a researcher at the [University of Turin](https://unito.it) (South Western Asia Archaeology). My research interests include Settlement Pattern Analysis, Remote Sensing, GIS, and mapping. 
I am currently part of the [Governance Policies and Political Landscapes in the Southern Levant under the Neo-Assyrian Empire project](https://www.dipstudistorici.unito.it/do/progetti.pl/Show?_id=0sk8) and [ReLand project](https://github.com/ReLandProject).

During my Ph.D. I analyzed Iron Age settlement patterns along the Euphrates river in ancient Mesopotamia. I used a landscape archaeology approach, also integrating geomorphology, remote sensing, quantitative and spatial analyses.
