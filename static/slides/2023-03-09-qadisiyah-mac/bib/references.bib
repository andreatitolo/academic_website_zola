Bien qu'une dichotomie culturelle assez nette soit perceptible entre cette occupation pastorale nomade et le monde sedentaire, la mobilite et l'exploitation des ressources naturelles specifiques au desert, pour la production d'eclats corticaux par exemple, semblent avoir ouvert la voie a de fortes interactions et a l'integration d'un systeme d'echanges avec le desert dans l'organisation socio-economique plus globale du sud levantin au cours du Chalcolithique et du Bronze ancien.},

  abstract = {Water bodies are essential to humans and other forms of life. Identification of water bodies can be useful in various ways, including estimation of water availability, demarcation of flooded regions, change detection, and so on. In past decades, Landsat satellite sensors have been used for land use classification and water body identification. Due to the introduction of a New Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor on Landsat 8 with a high spectral resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio, the quality of imagery sensed by Landsat 8 has improved, enabling better characterization of land cover and increased data size. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the most appropriate and practical water identification methods that take advantage of the improved image quality and use the fewest inputs based on the original OLI bands. The objective of the study is to explore the potential of a J48 decision tree (JDT) in identifying water bodies using reflectance bands from Landsat 8 OLI imagery. J48 is an open-source decision tree. The test site for the study is in the Northern Han River Basin, which is located in Gangwon province, Korea. Training data with individual bands were used to develop the JDT model and later applied to the whole study area. The performance of the model was statistically analysed using the kappa statistic and area under the curve (AUC). The results were compared with five other known water identification methods using a confusion matrix and related statistics. Almost all the methods showed high accuracy, and the JDT was successfully applied to the OLI image using only four bands, where the new additional deep blue band of OLI was found to have the third highest information gain. Thus, the JDT can be a good method for water body identification based on images with improved resolution and increased size.},

Sedentary life on the alluvial plains between the lower Tigris and Euphrates rivers can be traced back into at least the sixth millennium B.C., and by the early fourth millennium the world's earliest cities had come into existence there. The region has retained a deeply impressed urban stamp, yet Robert McC. Adams argues that the powers of cities were always contingent and transitory even in their heartland. The difficulties of irrigation agriculture in an arid landscape produced rivalries and uncertainties that could never be overcome for long. The whole urban edifice of power, privilege, tradition, and ceremony rested in the end on the subordination and exploitation of shifting, tribal agriculturalists and semi-nomads in restive hinterlands. Most existing evidence provides only an urban perspective on the interaction of cities with each other and with the countryside. In order to reconstruct the rural perspective, Adams analyzed the findings of more than two decades of archaeological surface reconnaissance, much of it in previously unsurveyed desert and all of it dependent upon the use of aerial photographs and satellite images. His findings establish broad patterns of change affecting the entire regional network of settlements and its supporting irrigation systems. In this way, Adams is able to place the oldest and most continuously documented example of the processes of urban genesis and decline in a more comprehensive geographical and historical setting than has ever been possible."--The dust-jacket flaps.

Alike in the human and natural worlds, complexity has repeatedly emerged as an overarching characterization through irregular, discontinuous processes of accumulation. These led by degrees and at intervals to relatively abrupt, qualitative changes. Under various constraints, contemporary archaeological research methods and objectives have not been accompanied by an adequate recognition of the centrality of increasing complexity as a social evolutionary tendency. Here it is argued that a focused, highly interdisciplinary study of complex adaptive systems is meanwhile coming to the fore that deserves careful archaeological scrutiny. A growing convergence of interests is suggested by shared issues like historical path-dependency, the interactions of differently situated and motivated human agents, differential returns to scale, and the range of possible, computer-generated outcomes of unpredictable combinations of orderly, random and stochastic processes and events. \textcopyright{} 2001 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the findings of the impact of atmospheric effects when applied on satellite images intended for supporting archaeological research. The study used eleven multispectral Landsat TM/ETM+ images from 2009 until 2010, acquired over archaeological and agricultural areas. The modified Darkest Pixel (DP) atmospheric correction algorithm was applied, as it is considered one of the most simple and effective atmospheric corrections algorithm. The NDVI equation was applied and its values were evaluated before and after the application of atmospheric correction to satellite images, to estimate its possible effects. The results highlighted that atmospheric correction has a significant impact on the NDVI values. This was especially true in seasons where the vegetation has grown. Although the absolute impact on NDVI, after applying the DP, was small (0.06), it was considered important if multi-temporal time series images need to be evaluated and cross-compared. The NDVI differences, before and after atmospheric correction, were assessed using student's t-test and the statistical differences were found to be significant. It was shown that relative NDVI difference can be as much as 50\%, if atmosphere effects are ignored. Finally, the results had proven that atmospheric corrections can enhance the interpretation of satellite images (especially in cases where optical thickness of water vapour is minimized {$\approx$} 0). This fact can assist in the detection and identification of archaeological crop marks. Therefore, removal of atmospheric effects, for archaeological purposes, was found to be of great importance in improving the image enhancement and NDVI values. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the authors.},

However, the use of vegetation indices for the detection of crop marks lacks in accuracy assessment and critical evaluation. In this study, 71 vegetation indices were indexed, from the relevant bibliography, and evaluated for their potential to detect such crop marks. During this study, several ground spectroradiometric campaigns took place, in a controlled archaeological environment in Cyprus, cultivated with barley crops, during a complete phenological cycle (2011\textendash 2012). All vegetation indices, both broadband and narrowband, were evaluated for their separability performance, and the results were presented through tables and diagrams. In the end, the use of more than one vegetation index is suggested in order to enhance the final results. In fact, several not widely used vegetation indices are suggested and evaluated using both Landsat TM and EO-1 Hyperion images.},

The latest are of significant value for the detection of buried archaeological features using remote sensing techniques. The proposed transformations, re-projects the initial VNIR bands of the satellite image, into a new 3D coordinate system where the first component is the so called "crop mark", the second component "vegetation" and the third component "soil". For the purpose of this study, a large ground spectral signature database has been explored and analyzed separately for each different satellite image. The narrow band reflectance has been re-calculated using the Relative Spectral Response filters of each sensor, and then a PCA analysis was carried out. Subsequently, the first three PCA components were rotated in order to enhance the detection of crop marks. Finally, all proposed transformations have been successfully evaluated in different existing archaeological sites and some interesting crop marks have been exposed.

For this reason, an extensive spectral library of crop marks, acquired through numerous spectroradiometric campaigns, which are related with buried archaeological remains, has been resampled to the spectral characteristics of Sentinel-2. In addition, other existing satellite sensors have been also evaluated (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM); Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER); IKONOS; Landsat 4 TM; Landsat 7 Enhance Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+); QuickBird; Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT); and WorldView-2). The simulated data have been compared with the optimum spectral regions for the detection of crop marks (700 nm and 800 nm). In addition, several existing vegetation indices have been also assessed for all sensors. As it was found, the spectral characteristics of Sentinel-2 are able to better distinguish crop marks compared to other existing satellite sensors. Indeed, as it was found, using a simulated Sentinel-2 image, not only known buried archaeological sites were able to be detected, but also other still unknown sites were able to be revealed.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the on-going research related to remote sensing archaeology in Europe, since the launch in 1999 of the first high resolution satellite sensor IKONOS. During these 16 years, significant technological improvements have been made both in space sensors as well in other non-contact remote sensing technologies, roviding new tools for scientists to search the hidden past. The analysis presented here follows a citation based approach, where useful information is retrieved from the scientific literature. The paper visualises these trends by constructing science maps, based on bibliographic data of established research journals, found in Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science (WoS) search engines. In addition, mapping and clustering analyses were carried out considering the Institutions that applied remote sensing technologies for archaeological purposes, thus providing a better insight and understanding of the current status of remote sensing archaeology in Europe. Time-stamped maps from 1999 until 2015 indicate on one hand that remote sensing technologies are widely accepted and applied by the archaeological community, but at the sametimetheymake clear that substantial gaps still exist amongst European countries. Finally, the popularity of specific terms or the emergence of newterms in scientific literature through time is also presented, providing a synoptic viewof the history and development of the remote sensing archaeology discipline. The discussion section analyses the gaps of the current studymainly due to "missing literature ". The paper underlines the need for the development of a common depository of all knowledge, acquired by the scientists operating in the field worldwide, to improve the " transfer of knowledge " and therefore harmonise the existing gap between the different scientific fields of remote sensing archaeology.},

  abstract = {The use of medium resolution, open access, and freely distributed satellite images, such as those of Landsat, is still understudied in the domain of archaeological research, mainly due to restrictions of spatial resolution. This investigation aims to showcase how the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel optical sensors can efficiently support archaeological research through object-based image analysis (OBIA), a relatively new scientific trend, as highlighted in the relevant literature, in the domain of remote sensing archaeology. Initially, the fusion of a 30mspatial resolution Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Level-2 and a 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel 2 Level-1C optical images, over the archaeological site of "Nea Paphos" in Cyprus, are evaluated in order to improve the spatial resolution of the Landsat image. At this step, various known fusion models are implemented and evaluated, namely Gram-Schmidt, Brovey, principal component analysis (PCA), and hue-saturation-value (HSV) algorithms. In addition, all four 10mavailable spectral bands of the Sentinel 2 sensor, namely the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands (Bands 2 to 4 and Band 8, respectively) were assessed for each of the different fusion models. On the basis of these findings, the next step of the study, focused on the image segmentation process, through the evaluation of different scale factors. The segmentation process is an important step moving from pixel-based to object-based image analysis. The overall results show that the Gram-Schmidt fusion method based on the near-infrared band of the Sentinel 2 (Band 8) at a range of scale factor segmentation to 70 are the optimum parameters for the detection of standing visible monuments, monitoring excavated areas, and detecting buried archaeological remains, without any significant spectral distortion of the original Landsat image. The new 10 m fused Landsat 8 image provides further spatial details of the archaeological site and depicts, through the segmentation process, important details within the landscape under examination.},

The analysis was conducted using medium-resolution Landsat 7 ETM+ images over the archaeological site of Apamea, at Syria. The site has been systematically and extensively looted in the recent past, attracting the interest of scholars. We propose a multi-temporal analysis of cloud-free multispectral Landsat 7 ETM+ images throughout the period between January 2011 to April 2012, just at the beginning of the Syrian war. The analysis was completed through the interpretation of pseudo-color temporal composites, investigation of the multi-temporal spectral profiles, correlations between the spectral bands, and the application of principal component analysis (PCA). The overall analysis was limited within the spectral range of 450\textendash 1750 nm. This wavelength range corresponds to the first five spectral bands of the Landsat images. Furthermore, we explored the big data cloud platform Google Earth Engine to detected looted areas. A supervised classification strategy was designed and performed on this cloud platform employing the Random Forest classifier. Finally, a time-stamp change detection approach was implemented. The overall findings were compared with available images from Google Earth Digital Globe and published articles and reports related to the Apamea archaeological site. It was found that the high revisit temporal resolution of the Landsat sensor was able to detect and map the looting activity in the area as a result of the spectral change in the archaeological landscape, despite its 30 m spatial resolution. At the same time, however, the analysis has provided other false-true detections in other areas in the landscape.},

  abstract = {Urban sprawl can negatively impact the archaeological record of an area. In order to study the urbanisation process and its patterns, satellite images were used in the past to identify land-use changes and detect individual buildings and constructions. However, this approach involves the acquisition of high-resolution satellite images, the cost of which is increases according to the size of the area under study, as well as the time interval of the analysis. In this paper, we implemented a quick, automatic and low-cost exploration of large areas, for addressing this purpose, aiming to provide at a medium resolution of an overview of the landscape changes. This study focuses on using radar Sentinel-1 images to monitor and detect multi-temporal changes during the period 2015\textendash 2020 in Limassol, Cyprus. In addition, the big data cloud platform, Google Earth Engine, was used to process the data. Three different change detection methods were implemented in this platform as follow: (a) vertical transmit, vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit, horizontal receive (VH) polarisations pseudo-colour composites; (b) the Rapid and Easy Change Detection in Radar Time-Series by Variation Coefficient (REACTIV) Google Earth Engine algorithm; and (c) a multi-temporal Wishart-based change detection algorithm. The overall findings are presented for the wider area of the Limassol city, with special focus on the archaeological site of ``Amathus'' and the city centre of Limassol. For validation purposes, satellite images from the multi-temporal archive from the Google Earth platform were used. The methods mentioned above were able to capture the urbanization process of the city that has been initiated during this period due to recent large construction projects.},

  abstract = {The appraisal of crop water requirements (CWR) is crucial for the management of water resources, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where irrigation represents the largest consumer of water, such as the Doukkala area, western Morocco. Simple and (semi) empirical approaches have been applied to estimate CWR: the first one is called Kc-NDVI method, based on the correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the crop coefficient (Kc); the second one is the analytical approach based on the direct application of the Penman-Monteith equation with reflectance-based estimates of canopy biophysical variables, such as surface albedo (r), leaf area index (LAI) and crop height (hc). A time series of high spatial resolution RapidEye (REIS), SPOT4 (HRVIR1) and Landsat 8 (OLI) images acquired during the 2012/2013 agricultural season has been used to assess the spatial and temporal variability of crop evapotranspiration ETc and biophysical variables. The validation using the dual crop coefficient approach (Kcb) showed that the satellite-based estimates of daily ETc were in good agreement with ground-based ETc, i.e., R2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 0.79 versus R2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 0.89 for the Kc-NDVI, respective of the analytical approach. The assessment of irrigation performance in terms of adequacy between water requirements and allocations showed that CWR were much larger than allocated surface water for the entire area, with this difference being small at the beginning of the growing season. Even smaller differences were observed between surface water allocations and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) throughout the irrigation season. Finally, surface water allocations were rather close to Net Irrigation Water Requirements (NIWR).},

It is the biggest dam where its storage capacity reaches 11.11 billion cubic meters at normal operational level (330 m. above sea level). The dam was constructed on alternating beds of karistified limestone, gypsum and marl. This dam suffered from water seepage under its foundation since its operation in 1986. Grouting operations were implemented since that time to overcome this problem. This seepage is believed to be due to dissolution of gypsum beds under the foundation, which was not carefully considered by the designers. It was recommended by the international board of experts that the water level should be kept at or below 319 m.a.s.l. to minimize damages in case of the failure of the dam. ISIS occupied the dam site on 8 August 2014 and it was seized back from the hands of ISIS on the 16th of the same month. They did plenty of damage despite the short period they occupied the area. After that, the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources rebuilt the damaged parts and used new grouting and maintenance program. Now, the dam looks very safe at 319 m water level at its reservoir. In addition, the impounding was raised 325 m.a.s.l. for few days and nothing abnormal was noticed.},

Iraq and Syria are the lower countries in the basin and for this reason they always like to ensure the quantity of water required to satisfy their requirements. The conflict between riparian countries is due to several factors. These are: population growth rate and food security, energy security, economic and technological development, political fragmentation, international water laws, water and management availability and public awareness. There have been a number of attempts to find a common ground on water issues between the main three riparian countries since 1920 but no agreement signed yet. Present situation is very bad in Syria and Iraq where thousands of people have no access to water and farmers are leaving their land because of draught. Such situation will definitely raise tension and might lead to war. To avoid this, a mediator that has the capability to bring all countries concerned to the negotiation table is required.

  abstract = {In July of 1860 the intra-mural Christian quarter of Damascus was looted and burned and thousands of its inhabitants were massacred. This horrific event, which arrived on the heels of sectarian bloodshed in Ottoman Mount Lebanon a month earlier, was all the more significant in light of the massacre of Christians in the northern city of Aleppo in 1850 and the blood-libel accusations against the Damascene Jewish community in 1840.   The events of July 1860 lasted a week during which the largely Greek Catholic (Uniate) inner-city Christian quarter of Bab Tuma was attacked. Although historians disagree over the number of Christians killed by the mob, up to ten thousand men, women, and children may have perished. The attackers also targeted Christian businesses, churches, and foreign consulates, and what could not be carried away was set ablaze. In the wake of those events, and in order to forestall European intervention on behalf of its minorities, the Ottoman government quickly moved to re-establish order and to punish the perpetrators. The 1840 blood-libel accusations\textemdash the first of their kind in Damascus\textemdash were leveled against several Jews when a Capuchin monk and his Muslim servant disappeared and their bodies were allegedly found in the Jewish quarter.  The shocks of the 1860 ``event'' (or  al-haditha  as the local court records refer to it) and the 1840 Damascus Affair were heightened not only by their suddenness, and indeed, novelty, but also because their targets\textemdash the Christian and Jewish communities of this Ottoman provincial city\textemdash were small in number and appeared to have led a life of relative historic obscurity.   The Christians comprised Greek (Syrian) Orthodox, Armenian, Maronite, and Catholic communities. Among the Jews there was a Karaite community. For an informative discussion of the Christians of the Arab East, see Robert M. Haddad,  Syrian Christians in Muslim Society: An Interpretation  (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1970). In the absence of reliable (official) figures, a rough average based on population estimates provided by European observers will have to suffice: in 1787 Volney estimated the Damascus population at eighty thousand people, twelve thousand of whom were Christian (M. C-F. Volney,  Voyage en Syrie et en Egypte pendant les annee's 1783, 1784, 1785  [Paris: Mouton, 1787; repr. 1959], vol. 2, p. 250). Half a century later, Porter reported that the population of the city totaled around 108,000 among whom 14,000 were Christians and 4,600 were Jews (J. L. Porter,  Five Years in Damascus Including an Account of the History, Topography, and Antiquities of that City with Travels and Researches in Palmyra, Lebanon, and the Hawran  [London: John Murray, 1855], vol. 1, p. 139). These figures closely approximate the estimates of the Bowring Report of a decade earlier (John Bowring,  Report on the Commercial Statistics of Syria  [London: William Clowes and Sons, 1840; repr., New York: Arno Press, 1973], p. 8). In 1890 Cuinet put the total population at 165,000 and estimated the Christians at 54,000 and the Jews at 5,000 (Vital Cuinet,  Syrie, Liban et Palestine: Ge'ographie administrative statistique, descriptive et raisonne'e  [Paris: E. Leroux, 1896], p. 386).  Despite their comparative importance in the socio-economic life of Damascus (and for reasons that relate to that city's interior location, among other factors) neither community had risen to particular regional or empire-wide prominence along the lines of, say, the Maronites in Mount Lebanon or the Greek Orthodox and Armenian communities of Istanbul. Historians have in general considered the two communities noteworthy, if they considered them at all, on account of the two events mentioned above, events that have since come to define much of their nineteenth-century history. As a result, narratives of these events are plentiful, found alongside accounts that focus on the wealth and fortune of a handful of Jewish and Christian men.   There is a large number of published Arabic-language accounts of the 1860 riots. See, for example,  Hasr al-litham  `an nakabat al-Sham (Cairo, 1895); Iskander ibn Ya`qub Abkarius,  The Lebanon in Turmoil: Syria and the Powers in 1860,  trans. J. F. Scheltema (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1920); Muhammad Abu'l Su`ud al- Hasibi, ``Lamhat min tarkikh Dimashq fi `ahd al-Tanzimat,'' ed. Kamal S.

Thackston, Jr. (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988), pp. 244\textendash 68.

On the Jewish community in general, see Moshe Ma'oz, ``Changes in the Position of the Jewish Communities of Palestine and Syria in the mid-Nineteenth Century,'' in  Studies on Palestine During the Ottoman Period,  ed. Moshe Ma'oz (Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, 1975); Thomas Philipp, ``The Farhi Family and the Changing Position of the Jews in Syria, 1750\textendash 1860,''  Middle Eastern Studies  20 (Oct. 1984); 37\textendash 52. See also al-Maghribi, ``Yahud Dimashq mundhu mi'at `am,''  al-Majma` al-`Ilmi al-`Arabi  9 (1929): 641\textendash 43; and Yusuf Nu`aisa,  Yahud Dimashq  (Damascus: Dar al-Ma`rifa, 1988); both of which are hostile to their subject matter.  Although those two facets of non-Muslim ( dhimmi )   The status of non-Muslims is inscribed in Islamic law in the form of a contract ( dhimma ).

LandSat images of years 2000, 2009 and 2018 are used to generate land use maps within the geographic information system. Current developed model was generated by integrating Population density data with land use classification maps to decompose the built-up development to three sub-classes: High, Medium and Low-density built-up land uses. Simulations of future land use pattern over the year 2018 based on these two prediction models reveal that the Modified Cellular Automata Markov Chain Modelling technique is more accurate than the Extended Markov Chain model. Spatial effects of built-up densities are validated in this study. Consequently, the extension of the Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model represents an innovative tool for regional and urban planning to forecast potential locative distribution of old and new urban agglomeration. The sequential shift of the urban areas among different density classes in addition to the interactions of urban agglomerations should be employed as a guiding tool for decision-makers and planners during the phase of developing new population and economic strategies, new urban Masterplan and during the process of enacting/developing new land-use policies. In the final part of the study, a simulation of land use pattern for the year 2036 is generated using TerrSet v.18 software and an analysis of the outcome for the forecasted map is discussed.},

Ornamental wall painting created a colorful and meaningful visual impact to the rooms of residences belonging to the Assyrian kings. The assembled material demonstrates that the polychrome and black-and-white decorated bands of geometric, floral, figural, and animal motifs were arranged into a variety of formulaic designs. Particular attention is given to the changing trends in the selection and combination of motifs, some of which had symbolic meaning. The chronology of the wall paintings at Til Barsip and the accompanying discussion of textile patterns are of special interest to the art historian. This book illustrates the ornamental wall paintings as recorded in the excavation reports. Discoveries of the wall paintings -- Til Barsip -- The ornamental painted designs.},

Taking a jargon-free approach, this teaching tool introduces the basic principles of statistics to archaeologists. The author covers the necessary techniques for analyzing data collected in the field and laboratory as well as for evaluating the significance of the relationships between variables. In addition, chapters discuss the special concerns of working with samples. This well-illustrated guide features several practice problems making it an ideal text for students in archaeology and anthropology.Using feedback from students and teachers who have been using the first edition, as well as another ten years of personal experience with the text, the author has provided an updated and revised second edition with a number of important changes. New topics covered include: -Proportions and Densities-Error Ranges for Medians-Resampling Approaches-Residuals from Regression-Point Sampling-Multivariate Analysis -Similarity Measures -Multidimensional Scaling -Principal Components Analysis -Cluster AnalysisThose already familiar with the clear and useful format of Statistics for Archaeologists will find this new edition a welcome update, and the new sections will make this seminal textbook an indispensible resource for a whole new group of students, professors, and practitioners. Praise for the first edition: "Robert Drennan has done the field a great service." Larry R. Kimball, American Antiquity, Vol 62 (1997)."There is a great deal to recommend this book.... It is written in an engaging style...and it is consistently focused on the practical problems of archaeological analysis." Robert E. Dewar, SAS Bulletin, July 1997...".this book is highly recommended." Gary Lock, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol 101 (1997)."I will use this book when I teach statistics in the future, and I will gladly recommend it to others." Randall McGuire, Historical Archaeology, Vol 32 (1998)."an excellent introductory textbook ...introducing complex ideas on statistics to students in a practical, non-threatening way....

To date, much of the literature on SES analysis has fo- cused on ``neat'' systems involving a single type of resource, a group of users, and a governance system. While these studies provide valuable and specific insights, they are of limited use for application to ``messy'' SESs that encompass the totality of human settlements, including social organization and technologies that result in the movement of mate- rials, energy, water, and people. These considerations, in turn, create distribution systems that lead to different types of SESs. In messy SESs the concept of resilience, or the ability of a system to withstand perturbation while maintain- ing function, is further evolved to posit that different settlements will require different approaches to foster resilience. This article introduces a typology for refining SESs to improve short- and long-term adaptive strategies in developing human settlements.},

This integration,when applied by skilled farmers, leads to amanagement of natural resources in analtruistic fashion and not merely to economicends. Moreover, it makes agriculture meaningfuland sustainable.},

  abstract = {This study examines ALOS-2 PALSAR L-band dual-polarization (HH and HV) SAR data and Landsat-8 optical imagery for land cover classification. The SAR data has been preprocessed first, which included radiometric calibration, geocoding, and speckle filtering. The HH/HV band ratio has been used to create the third band, and thus a synthetic RGB SAR image was created. The Landsat-8 data was also preprocessed for the classification process. For land cover classification of both SAR and optical datasets, the supervised maximum likelihood classifier was used. Training samples were selected from the Landsat-8 optical imagery with the support of information available in Google Earth; the same pixel locations of training data were used to extract training data from SAR image as well. The Landsat-8 optical imagery was classified and also used for visual assessment of the SAR land cover classification results. Accuracy assessment has been done for both the results of SAR and Landsat-8 data. The SAR classified output gives us accuracy of 93.15\% and the Landsat-8 classified map accuracy was 91.34\%, while the Kappa coefficient for SAR and Landsat-8 classified images is 0.92 and 0.89, respectively. Classification limitations exist in some cases, such as roads being merged in vegetation areas and some of the barren land is merged in settlements. The land cover classification can be expected to be further improved using polarimetric decomposition methods and fusion of SAR data with optical data.},

Such change has been and continues to be monitored through the use of satellite imagery, aerial photography, and technical reports. While these monitoring tools are useful in observing the empirical results of land use change and issues of sustainability, the data they provide are often not useful in capturing the fundamental policies, social drivers, and unseen factors that shape how landscapes are transformed. In addition, some monitoring approaches can be prohibitively expensive and too slow in providing useful data at a timescale in which data are needed. This paper argues that techniques using information fusion and conducting assessments of continuous data feeds can be beneficial for monitoring primary social and ecological mechanisms affecting how geographic settings are changed over different time scales. We present a computational approach that couples open source tools in order to conduct an analysis of text data, helping to determine relevant events and trends. To demonstrate the approach, we discuss a case study that integrates varied newspapers from two Midwest states in the United States, Iowa and Nebraska, showing how potentially significant issues and events can be captured. Although the approach we present is useful for monitoring current web-based data streams, we argue that such a method should ultimately be integrated closely with less managed systems and modeling techniques to enhance not only land use monitoring but also to better forecast and understand landscape change.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018, The Author(s). Scaling methods have been applied to study modern urban areas and how they create accelerated, feedback growth in some systems while efficient use in others. For ancient cities, results have shown that cities act as social reactors that lead to positive feedback growth in socioeconomic measures. In this paper, we assess the relationship between settlement area expressed through mound area from Late Chalcolithic and Bronze Age sites and mean hollow way widths, which are remains of roadways, from the Khabur Triangle in northern Mesopotamia. The intent is to demonstrate the type of scaling and relationship present between sites and hollow ways, where both feature types are relatively well preserved. For modern roadway systems, efficiency in growth relative to population growth suggests roads should show sublinear scaling in relation to site size. In fact, similar to modern systems, such sublinear scaling results are demonstrated for the Khabur Triangle using available data, suggesting ancient efficiency in intensive transport growth relative to population levels. Comparable results are also achieved in other ancient Near East regions. Furthermore, results suggest that there could be a general pattern relevant for some small sites (0\textendash 2~ha) and those that have fewer hollow ways, where {$\beta$}, a measure of scaling, is on average low ({$\approx$} {$<$} 0.2). On the other hand, a second type of result for sites with many hollow ways (11 or more) and that are often larger suggests that {$\beta$} is greater (0.23\textendash 0.72), but still sublinear. This result could reflect the scale in which larger settlements acted as greater social attractors or had more intensive economic activity relative to smaller sites. The provided models also allow estimations of past roadway widths in regions where hollow ways are missing.},

  abstract = {The Assyrian capitals of Nineveh, Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Ashur were the most important cities of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Historical and archaeological sources indicate significant investments by the Assyrian state on these capitals during the Neo-Assyrian period. Not only were these cities a focus during this period, but the landscape surrounding them was transformed by policies and actions taken by individuals and the state. Despite the significant influence the Assyrians had on their landscape, much of the region surrounding the Assyrian capitals has never been significantly studied and published. Mark Altaweel investigated anthropogenic transformations of the physical landscape surrounding the Assyrian capitals, using remote sensing sources. In his book he uses satellite data, including CORONA, ASTER, and elevation data to locate and analyze archaeological sites, hollow ways, and irrigation features. Features recovered from remote sensing data are studied together to better reconstruct the archaeological landscape. The relationship of these features to the physical landscape is investigated using coupled agent-based social and mathematical ecological models (i.e. socio-ecological modeling). Socio-ecological modeling enables more rigorous estimates on the potential of archaeological features affecting landscape dynamics than other analytical methods. The results obtained by this work show that the Neo-Assyrian central region was exceptional in contrast to other areas and contemporary landscapes. Methods and outputs from this research are relatively new in Near Eastern archaeology in combining remote sensing data with socio-ecological modeling. More broadly, the remains and outputs produced from studying the Assyrian capitals' landscape can provide a significant amount of data for future studies and serve as a model for other empires with similar central regions of political and economic activities.},

Field systems around late third millennium BC (Ur III period) cities are modeled in order to understand the effects of salinization and what strategies might limit progressive salinization that hinders agricultural yields. Scholars have long suspected that progressive salinization may constrain irrigation agriculture in southern Mesopotamia. This is not only demonstrated by modeling, but methods to mitigate the effects of salinization and promote the resilience of agricultural systems are presented. Strategies that incorporate fallowing regimes and which promote natural and/or engineered leaching create resilient agricultural systems in which ancient farmers could have made decisions about when to crop and irrigate based on the effects of salinization. Simulation results not only demonstrate to what extent and under what conditions salinization could be limited, but also model results indicate that irrigation-induced salinity could have ultimately become a major constraint to settlements and agriculture in southern Mesopotamia.},

The approach is applied to model the movement of people and goods in urban settings to study how settlement size hierarchy develops. While entropy maximization is well known for assessing settlement structure change over different spatiotemporal settings, approaches have rarely attempted to develop and apply this methodology to understand how individual and house-hold decisions may affect settlement size distributions. A new method devel-oped in this paper allows individual decision-makers to chose where to settle based on social-environmental factors, evaluate settlements based on geography and relative benefits, while retaining concepts derived from entropy maximiza-tion with settlement size affected by movement ability and site attractiveness feedbacks. To demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical and methodolog-ical approach, case study settlement patterns from the Middle Bronze (MBA) and Iron Ages (IA) in the Iraqi North Jazirah Survey (NJS) are used. Results indicate clear differences in settlement factors and household choices in simu-lations that lead to settlement size hierarchies comparable to the two evaluated periods. Conflict and socio-political cohesion, both their presence and absence, are suggested to have major roles in affecting the observed settlement hierarchy. More broadly, the model is made applicable for different empirically based settings, while being generalized to incorporate data uncertainty, making the model useful for understanding urbanism from top-down and bottom-up perspectives.},

For archaeological networks, several models based on assumptions concerning distance among sites, site size, or costs and benefits have been proposed to infer missing ties. Since these assumptions are formulated at a dyadic level, they do not provide means to express dependencies among ties and therefore include less plausible network scenarios. In this paper we investigate the use of network models that explicitly incorporate tie dependence. In particular, we consider exponential random graph models, and show how they can be applied to reconstruct networks coherent with Burt's arguments on closure and structural holes (Burt 2001). The approach is illustrated on data from the Middle Bronze Age in the Aegean.},

Especially from the VIII century BC on, the Assyrian policy of settlement in conquered regions led to a wide-ranging occupation of all the available landscapes in many of the conquered provinces. The result is a large amount of excavations with materials dating back to that period. The Atlas aims to develop a global typology that can be applied to the whole Assyrian repertory, in order to highlight the main types and to define their precise chronology and diffusion in the various regions conquered by Assyrians"--Page 4 of cover.},

Moreover, its theory of history emphasizes an ongoing and active resistance to concentrations of power. We present an anarchist analysis of the development of social power, authority, and status within the Coast Salish region of the Northwest Coast. Coast Salish peoples exhibited complex displays of chiefly authority and class stratification but without centralized political organization. Ethnographically, their sociopolitical formation is unique in allowing a majority of ``high-class'' people and a minority of commoners and slaves, or what Wayne Suttles described as an ``inverted-pear'' society.

In the process, we provide a case history of Lil'wat peoples, who continue to exert control over their unceded territory and heritage from development. In recent decades, the Lil'wat Peoples Movement used direct actions in logging road blockades, to stop developments from damaging and destroying archaeological sites, of which Johnny Jones was a member.

In so doing, they exhibited a strong degree of local and individual autonomy. Sociopolitically, they were anarchic, without formal institutions of government, and their villages were decentralized in structure. Yet they coordinated their defences on scales of organization beyond the local household, requiring the negotiation of consensus among those independent households. In this article, I apply an anarchist analysis to evaluate Coast Salish defensive strategies reflected in fortifications and refuges for the period from 1600 bp through the early post-contact period. Using ethnographic studies, I consider how Coast Salish peoples were able to balance local autonomy against the shared societal needs of coordinated defensive action and examine how these dynamics were materialized in defensive features in the landscape.},

The managerial university focuses on rationalization and efficiency, and believes in market mechanisms. These different viewpoints lie at the root of many conflicts. Moreover, one cannot see these issues in isolation. The logic of the managerial university reflects a shift from knowledge communities to knowledge enterprises. This conflicts with the logic of the academic profession, valuing academic autonomy and academic freedom. In the 2007 Changing Academic Profession survey, Japanese academics regarded the threats of the looming bureaucracy as almost as dangerous as did the academics surveyed in 1992 in the context of the Carnegie international comparative study on the academic profession, which was carried out in Europe and the US. This report intends to analyse the results of the CAP survey in order to compare the similarities and differences of academic staff's reactions to the managerial university from an international perspective. More specifically, the focus will be on the following topics: (1) the role of knowledge and academic vision; (2) decision making; (3) the role of institutional missions and profiles; (4) the impact of incentives and sanctions; (5) supervisory mechanisms; and (6) cooperation.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017) is a cloud computing platform designed for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. Its multi-petabyte data catalog and computation services are accessed via an Internet-accessible API. The API is exposed through JavaScript and Python client libraries. Google provides a browser-based IDE for the JavaScript API, and while convenient and useful for rapid data exploration and script development, it does not allow third-party package integration, relying solely on Google Maps and Google Charts for data visualization, and proprietary systems for metadata viewing and asset management. In contrast, the Python and Node.js distributions offer much flexibility for developers to integrate with third-party libraries. However, without the structure of a dedicated IDE, casual users can be left directionless and daunted. A significant gap exists between these two offerings (Google-supported JavaScript IDE and base client libraries) where convenience and flexibility meet. We propose to fill this gap with an R package that wraps the Earth Engine Python API to provide R users with a familiar interface, rapid development features, and flexibility to analyze data using open-source, third-party packages. rgee is an Earth Engine (EE) client library for R that allows users to leverage the strengths of the R spatial ecosystem and Google Earth Engine in the same workflow. All of the Earth Engine Python API classes, modules, and functions are made available through the reticulate package (Ushey, Allaire, \& Tang, 2020), which embeds a Python session within an R session, enabling seamless interoperability. Additionally, rgee adds several new features such as (i) new I/O design, (ii) interactive map display, (iii) easy extraction of time series, (iv) asset management interface, and (v) metadata display. In addition, rgee also makes it possible to execute Earth Engine Python code from within R, making the translation of large Python projects unnecessary.},

Moreover, three important coastal cities (Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos) paid tribute, and Jehu, the king of Israel, submitted to Assyrian power. Between 740 and 732 BCE, a large part of the Syria and the Levant was annexed by the Assyrian empire, Tiglath-pileser III. When Shalmaneser died in the winter of 722/721 BCE, the Assyrian army returned to Assyria, and the annexation and reorganization of Samaria was postponed. With Sargon II, Assyria's second extensive annexation phase in the west began. Sargon led half of his campaigns to Syria and the Levant, where the northwestern region, in particular, required his attention.},

Among the most significant engineering projects were the Assyrian hydraulic installations created from the 13th century BCE onward in conjunction with the foundation of new royal residences or with the reshaping of existing cities. Timber was scarce in Assyria but was indispensable for the roofing of buildings and the construction of gates, and thus its acquisition and transport represented a particular concern. The water transport of timber is attested several times in the correspondence of Sargon II. Another method for transportation is shown on a wall relief from Sargon's palace in Dur-\v{S}arrukin.},

In 2008, surface collection and limited soundings on the northern tell revealed archaeological material that appeared to derive from the Neolithic period. While microlithic materials near the tell pointed to a possible Khiamian and Natufian occupation on the edge of the basaltic plateau, naviform blades on the tell slopes as well as pottery sherds suggested the possibility of a long Neolithic occupation spanning the Pre- Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) to the Chalcolithic.‚Ä®Two seasons of excavation at different locations on the northern tell and the basaltic plateau facing it have produced improved chronological and cultural models of the Southern Levant in a region that has thus far been lacking in well-preserved archaeological sequences from the Natufian to the Chalcolithic.},

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers are nowadays commonly used in monitoring applications, e.g., in estimating crustal and infrastructure displacements. This is basically due to the recent improvements in GNSS instruments and methodologies that allow high-precision positioning, 24 h availability and semiautomatic data processing. In this paper, GNSS-estimated displacements on a dam structure have been analyzed and compared with pendulum data. This study has been carried out for the Eleonora D'Arborea (Cantoniera) dam, which is in Sardinia. Time series of pendulum and GNSS over a time span of 2.5 years have been aligned so as to be comparable. Analytical models fitting these time series have been estimated and compared. Those models were able to properly fit pendulum data and GNSS data, with standard deviation of residuals smaller than one millimeter. These encouraging results led to the conclusion that GNSS technique can be profitably applied to dam monitoring allowing a denser description, both in space and time, of the dam displacements than the one based on pendulum observations.},

This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability.

  abstract = {As cities get bigger, they generate economies and diseconomies of scale, referred to by Marshall more than a century ago as the effects of agglomeration (1). Simple theories assume that cities exist due to a trade-off between these positive and negative forces of agglomeration and that the benefits continue to outweigh the costs of cities as they grow ever larger (2). But precisely what happens as cities grow? On page 1438 of this issue, Bettencourt (3) shows that the ways in which people interact with one another in cities lead to power laws\textemdash or allometric laws\textemdash that relate population, area, and attributes of the population to scale.},

  abstract = {After the demise of the Assyrian state at the end of the seventh century BCE, Babylon, its long time rival and cultural sibling, emerged as hegemonic power in Mesopotamia and the Levant. Late Babylonian cuneiform documentation is remarkably rich and varied. The picture which emerges from that documentation is inevitably lop-sided, viewing Assyria through the lens of a world centered on Babylon and its cultural, religious, and political achievements. Evidence shows that Assyria had not been entirely forgotten, at least among the literate classes who controlled the temples and cuneiform learning. The memory of Assyria did not live on solely in the royal scriptoria. Neo- and Late Babylonian archival texts contain thousands of personal names. With the advent of Persian rule, cuneiform became confined largely to the temples and the private sphere. The Hellenistic period witnessed a revival of Babylonian civilization, now confined largely to the temples and the social groups that gravitated around them.},

  abstract = {Archaeologists have been aware of the potential of satellite imagery as a tool almost since the first Earth remote sensing satellite. Initially sensors such as Landsat had a ground resolution which was too coarse for thorough archaeological prospection although the imagery was used for geo-archaeological and enviro-archaeological analyses. In the intervening years the spatial and spectral resolution of these sensing devices has improved. In recent years two important occurrences enhanced the archaeological applicability of imagery from satellite platforms: The declassification of high resolution photography by the American and Russian governments and the deregulation of commercial remote sensing systems allowing the collection of sub metre resolution imagery. This thesis aims to evaluate the archaeological application of three potentially important resources: Corona space photography and Ikonos panchromatic and multispectral imagery. These resources are evaluated in conjunction with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery over a 600 square km study area in the semi-arid environment around Homs, Syria. The archaeological resource in this area is poorly understood, mapped and documented. The images are evaluated for their ability to create thematic layers and to locate archaeological residues in different environmental zones. Further consideration is given to the physical factors that allow archaeological residues to be identified and how satellite imagery and modern technology may impact on Cultural Resource Management. This research demonstrates that modern high resolution and historic satellite imagery can be important tools for archaeologists studying in semi-arid environments. The imagery has allowed a representative range of archaeological features and landscape themes to be identified. The research shows that the use of satellite imagery can have significant impact on the design of the archaeological survey in the middle-east and perhaps in other environments.},

  abstract = {The Iraqi (Mesopotamian) Marshes, an extensive wetlands system in Iraq, has been heavily impacted by both human and climate forces over the past decades. In the period leading up to the Second Gulf War in 2002, the marshlands were shrinking due to both a policy of draining and water diversion in Iraq and construction of dams upstream on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Following the war through 2006, this trend was reversed as the diversions were removed and active draining stopped. A combination of MODIS and GRACE datasets were used to determine the change in surface water area (SWA) in the marshes, marshland extent and change in mass both upriver in the Tigris and Euphrates watersheds and in the marshlands. Results suggest that the post war dam removal and decreased pumping in 2003 provided only temporary respite for the marshlands \textbackslash n(2003\textendash 2006 SWA: 1,477 km2 increase (600\%), water equivalent depth (WED): +2.0 cm/yr.; 2006\textendash 2009: -860 km2 (-41\%) WED: -3.9 cm/yr.). Unlike in the period 2003\textendash 2006, from 2006 forward the mass variations in the marshes are highly correlated with those in the upper and middle watershed (R = 0.86 and 0.92 respectively), suggesting that any recovery due to that removal is complete, and that all future changes are tied more strongly to any climate changes that will affect recharge in the upper Tigris-Euphrates system. Precipitation changes in the watershed show a reduction of an average of 15\% below the 15 yr mean in 2007\textendash 2011 This corresponds with published ensemble predictions for the 2071\textendash 2099 time period, that suggested similar marshland shrinkage should be expected in that time period.},

It was probably a local lifestyle that existed in the region parallel to the Canaanite culture and is represented by different architectural types and by a unique local pottery.

  abstract = {With urban population increasing dramatically worldwide, cities are playing an increasingly critical role in human societies and the sustainability of the planet. An obstacle to effective policy is the lack of meaningful urban metrics based on a quantitative understanding of cities. Typically, linear per capita indicators are used to characterize and rank cities. However, these implicitly ignore the fundamental role of nonlinear agglomeration integral to the life history of cities. As such, per capita indicators conflate general nonlinear effects, common to all cities, with local dynamics, specific to each city, failing to provide direct measures of the impact of local events and policy. Agglomeration nonlinearities are explicitly manifested by the superlinear power law scaling of most urban socioeconomic indicators with population size, all with similar exponents (1.15). As a result larger cities are disproportionally the centers of innovation, wealth and crime, all to approximately the same degree. We use these general urban laws to develop new urban metrics that disentangle dynamics at different scales and provide true measures of local urban performance. New rankings of cities and a novel and simpler perspective on urban systems emerge. We find that local urban dynamics display long-term memory, so cities under or outperforming their size expectation maintain such (dis)advantage for decades. Spatiotemporal correlation analyses reveal a novel functional taxonomy of U.S. metropolitan areas that is generally not organized geographically but based instead on common local economic models, innovation strategies and patterns of crime.},

  abstract = {This paper has emphasized the highly reflexive approach necessary for the correct identification and interpretation of the processes behind settlement patterns. In our opinion, the key challenges are: (i) to define a sample/study area and its levels of search intensity appropriately (correcting for or exploring ``edge effects'' statistically where necessary); (ii) to assess and sub-divide site size, function and date range (analysing comparable features only and/or arbitrating uncertain cases statistically); (iii) to account for the resource structure of the landscape (either by only considering environmental homogenous sub-regions or by factoring resource preferences into the significance-testing stage of analysis), and (iv) to use techniques of analysis that are sensitive to detecting patterns at different spatial scales. The latter in particular is an area increasingly well-explored in other disciplines, but as yet with minimal impact on archaeological practice. There remains some value in Clark and Evan's nearest neighbour function for identifying relationships between sites at one scale of analysis, but it may fail to detect larger-scale patterning. More critically, the dichotomy it encourages between ``nucleated'' and ``dispersed'' is at best an overly simplistic model and, at worst, bears little relationship to the reality of settlement organization, which at different scales can show both nucleated and dispersed components. In our Kytheran case study, there is obviously further work to be done, but even with the existing dataset, we have shown that using a combination of Monte Carlo testing, frequency distributions, local density mappings and Ripley's K function allows a more sensitive assessment of multiscalar patters and therefore a more critical evaluation of the processes underlying settlement distributions.},

  abstract = {While distribution maps are nearly as old as the discipline of archaeology itself, most archaeologists still rely on personal intuition with regard to their assessment both of the spatial patterns they recover and the environmental processes and human behaviours that might be behind these patterns. To some extent, this general preference for intuitive readings of space in the archaeological record probably reflects several decades of disillusionment with quantitative spatial methods, after a flurry of early interest during the 1970s (e.g. Hodder and Orton 1976; Clarke 1977), and a continuing wish to prioritise the study of cultural spaces as subjectively experienced and meaningfully constituted by their human inhabitants (e.g. Gregory and Urry eds. 1985). Interestingly, even the enthusiastic uptake of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) from the 1990s onwards did little to change this situation with regard to spatial pattern analysis, as most off-?-the-?-shelf GIS software was targeted at data management and querying, digital cartography and enhanced visualisation, as well as certain focused modelling agendas (e.g. terrain, visibility and movement). Effectively, the study of distribution maps in archaeology merely carried on as it was, with a healthy dose of expert intuition, and perhaps in slightly richer visual form. However, while human involvement in the act of interpretation is undeniably a crucial and enduring aspect of archaeological research, there remain good reasons to characterise spatial distributions in more formal, quantitative ways. This paper focuses on a set of point pattern and process models that, we argue, now puts archaeologists in a position to return to the analysis of spatial pattern and process with renewed ambition, especially with regard to distribution maps. The first section below considers current theoretical approaches to point distributions and subsequent sections then address three cases studies that highlight some important conceptual issues and new analytical opportunities. 2.},

This paper highlights a model of spatial interaction and settlement evolution that has long been popular in urban geography and which was first applied to model historical settlement hierarchies some twenty-five years ago, but whose use since then for archaeological purposes has been very limited. Via a case study from Bronze Age Crete, we extend the analytical range of this model by suggesting ways in which it can (a) remain effective in the presence of missing data, (b) be given a stronger grounding in the physical landscape, and/or (c) be used to consider the evolutionary trajectory of settlements and physical routes over time. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the absence of field inspection in this inaccessible region, we use different remote sensing methods to first identify and classify archaeological features, and then explore the geomorphological factors that might have influenced their spatial distribution.},

Anne-Marie Bianquis commence par pr\'esenter des donn\'ees g\'en\'erales sur cette r\'egion agricole (\'el\'ements physiques, paysage, am\'enagements hydrauliques, peuplement, structures agraires) pour ensuite retracer son histoire et celle de la Syrie depuis la fin de l'Empire ottoman.  Son travail se concentre ensuite sur la l\'egislation de la r\'eforme agraire dans ses diverses \'etapes ainsi que ses phases successives et ses applications dans l'oasis. Se fondant sur une documentation provenant tant du Minist\`ere de l'Agriculture et de la R\'eforme Agraire que de nombreuses enqu\^etes de terrain, l'auteur fait le point sur les processus d'expropriation, de redistribution des terres, de cr\'eation de coop\'eratives et de constitution d'un secteur public agricole.  Les derni\`eres pages dressent quant \`a elles un bilan de ces r\'eformes. Elles rappellent \'egalement les bouleversements \'economiques qui ont frapp\'e la r\'egion d\`es la fin des ann\'ees 1970 \textendash{} notamment les deux chocs p\'etroliers \textendash{} et leur r\^ole dans la reconfiguration de l'oasis, qui tend alors de plus en plus \`a s'urbaniser.},

  abstract = {The alluvial plain of the Ceyhan River (SE Turkey) has been populated since the Neolithic. In 1954, Marjory Veronica Seton-Williams described for this area several archeological mounds (h\"oy\"uk), which are the remains of ancient settlements. Today, according to the archeological research carried out in the area, some of these mounds result to have been leveled by agricultural activities. In this work, we identified many color anomalies by low-cost remote-sensing analyses of satellite images. We checked the nature of these anomalies in a dedicated survey and we found a good correspondence between color anomalies and archeological remains consistent with leveled h\"oy\"uk. We compared the grain size and chemical characteristics of the soil collected inside the color anomalies with the soil collected in other areas of the alluvial plain. We found irrelevant differences in grain-size characteristics, but a higher content of CaCO3 in soils collected inside the anomalies with respect to those collected outside. Therefore, the content of CaCO3 could be considered the feature that makes the color anomalies visible. The reason for this higher content of CaCO3 is related to the anthropogenic material used in the different phases of h\"oy\"uk growth. This work suggests a low-cost analysis useful for rapid identification and preservation of archeological information on the history of Mediterranean settlement.},

  abstract = {The adoption of satellite imagery in archaeology is well recognized today, and is rapidly increasing with the greater availability of high resolution sensors, in the past limited solely to military applications. The metrical use of declassified satellite images from the intelligence CORONA project, the first US operational space photo reconnaissance project operating in the period 1960-1972, has been verified within the framework of a multidisciplinary research project carried out by the University of Bologna, in collaboration with Istanbul University and Gaziantep archaeological museum, at the archaeological site of Tilmen H\"oy\"uk (south-eastern Turkey) and its surrounding landscape. These images, characterized by a panoramic geometry, indeed represent an important historical resource for photointerpretation in archaeology, but their metrical use is difficult, owing to the severe distortions affecting the acquisition together with the problems of finding technical data related to the missions. In order to produce metric products of sufficient quality for mapping purposes, a high resolution scanned copy of a CORONA image of the relevant area was processed using commercial digital photogrammetric workstations operating with different approaches, whose aim was to evaluate the potential and specific problems connected to these kinds of data. A full orientation and digital triangulation of these images is possible if all the technical data on the sensor and the acquisition are well-known, and in any case the existence of well-distributed and reliable ground control points in the study area is crucial. The results obtained are interesting as they allow for integration, on a common cartographic reference base, with current aerial and satellite imagery (medium to very high geometric resolution) to perform automatic or visual change analysis procedures. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We attempt to overcome these shortcomings by subjecting the theory to a rigorous attempt at falsification using systematic cross-cultural analysis based on a world-wide sample of societies. We describe the theory, show how we operationalized it for cross-cultural comparative coding, and describe the main results of our analysis.},

Going forward, fieldwork must be made safe and inclusive. To achieve this, we must understand why sexual misconduct takes place during fieldwork. We surveyed an international sample of archaeologists and anthropologists (n=300) about their most recent fieldwork experience. We examine evidence for risk factors predicting sexual misconduct in fieldsites, and our findings suggest that length of fieldwork, presence and communication of policies and protocols, and the gender and sexuality of the individual are all significant. In particular, we find evidence for increased risk to nonmale and nonheterosexual individuals. We also gathered qualitative evidence from our respondents, who reported that in some cases they were discouraged from reporting and faced retaliation, they were dissatisfied with the handling of complaints, and fieldsite policies and protocols were not consistently or effectively implemented. Fieldwork can be a high-risk environment for marginalized individuals to experience sexual misconduct, and when clear policies and procedures are lacking, it can also be a low-risk environment for perpetrators in terms of consequences. To make fieldwork a safe environment for all, policies and protocols that mitigate the risk of sexual misconduct must be consistently implemented and properly communicated.},

La Syrie du sud basaltique a pr\'eserv\'e des t\'emoignages tr\`es importants de ces am\'enagements, dont la mise en place a commenc\'e au 4\`eme mill\'enaire. Une deuxi\`eme phase d'am\'enagements a \'et\'e r\'ealis\'ee \`a la p\'eriode romaine, et les infrastructures en ont \'et\'e exploit\'ees jusqu'au d\'ebut du xxe si\`ecle. On peut ainsi reconstituer l'histoire de ces syst\`emes sur pr\`es de six mill\'enaires, et en parall\`ele identifier les principaux syst\`emes sociaux qui peuvent \^etre associ\'es \`a ces installations. Leur caract\'eristique majeure est d'\^etre des organisations locales de gestion, sans intervention perceptible de l'Etat, except\'e dans des grands travaux de type aqueducs monumentaux.;Apart from the hydraulic systems linked to the major rivers, the control of water in the Near East passes by the exploitation of seasonal resources which are complementary: springs and river floods. Southern Syria preserves many traces of this exploitation. The main techniques of water catchment and storage were elaborate during the 4th millennium. A second phase of installations dates back to the Roman period which constituted the basic and sustainable network of the water supply until the 20th century. One can thus follow over six millennia the processes of technical innovation, and the main related social structures. The most outstanding characteristic of the water systems is their local management without interference of the main regional political powers, in the exception of large building works such as the monumental aqueducts.;ÿ®ÿπŸäÿØÿßŸã ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ∏ŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿßÿ¶Ÿäÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ£ŸÜŸáÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ®Ÿäÿ±ÿ©ÿå ŸÅÿ•ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿ∑ÿ±ÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸäÿßŸá ÿ™ÿ™ŸÖ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿßÿ∑ŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ÿ∑Ÿäÿ© ŸàÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ≠ÿØŸàÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿØŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿßŸÅÿ© ÿπÿ®ÿ± ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ´ŸÖÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖŸäÿßŸá ÿßŸÑŸÅÿµŸÑŸäÿ© Ÿàÿ¨ÿ± ŸÖŸäÿßŸá ÿßŸÑŸäŸÜÿßÿ®Ÿäÿπ ÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿØÿßÿ¶ŸÖÿ© Ÿàÿ™ÿ≠ŸàŸäŸÑ ŸÖŸäÿßŸá ÿßŸÑŸÅŸäÿ∂ÿßŸÜÿßÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜŸáÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ§ŸÇÿ™ÿ©.

Additionally, they are recognised as an integral management mechanism used to address Climate Change, and some consider them to be a driver for sustainable community development. To date, these areas have been used primarily to protect the natural environment, but there is both a clear justification and need to integrate cultural heritage into this network of sites. Such an integrated model would allow for the better realisation of the socio-economic development aspirations around MPA designation, and allow for broader inclusivity, and participatory community action and engagement. The integration of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage into these frameworks will support enhanced social cohesion, and a strengthening of place-making.},

  abstract = {Freshwater availability is critical for human survival, and in the Saharo-Arabian desert belt repeated fluctuations between aridity and humidity over the Quaternary mean the distribution of freshwater was likely a primary control upon routes and opportunities for hominin dispersals. However, our knowledge of the spatio-temporal distribution of palaeohydrological resources within Arabia during Mid-Late Pleistocene episodes of climatic amelioration remains limited. In this paper we outline a combined method for remotely mapping the location of palaeodrainage and palaeolakes in currently arid regions that were formerly subject to more humid conditions. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by mapping palaeochannels across the whole Arabian Peninsula, and palaeolakes and marshes for select regions covering c. 10\% of its surface. Our palaeodrainage mapping is based upon quantitative thresholding of HydroSHEDs data, which applies flow routing to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, while our palaeolake mapping uses an innovative method where spectral classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery is used to detect palaeolake deposits within endorheic (closed) basins, before modelling maximum lake extents by flooding the basin to the level of the elevation of the highest detected deposit. Field survey in the Nefud desert and the Dawadmi and Shuwaymis regions of Saudi Arabia indicates accuracies of 86\% for palaeodrainage mapping, and 96\% for identifying former palaeolake basins (73\% accuracy of classification of individual deposits). The palaeolake mapping method has also demonstrated potential for identifying surface and stratified archaeological site locations, with 76\% of the surveyed palaeolake basins containing archaeological material, including stratified Palaeolithic archaeology. Initial examination of palaeodrainage in relation to archaeological sites indicates a relationship between mapped features and previously recorded Palaeolithic sites. An example of the application of these data for period-specific regional palaeohydrological and archaeological reconstructions is presented for a region of Northern Saudi Arabia covering the southern Nefud desert and adjacent lava fields.},

In working on prototype sites, we have taken a multidisciplinary approach of surveillance and preventive archaeology, and have collaborated with archaeologists, geologists, hydro-biologists, and engineers. In this area of research, often lakes, lagoons, and rivers are characterized by low visibility. Some Quaternary events have deeply modified Ferrara's landscape. Analysis of preserved samples from micro-drillings, underwater direct and indirect surveys, and the cataloguing of historical artefacts, are giving to the researchers a remarkable ancient chronology line. Recent studies confirmed anthropization sequences from the 1st Century B.C. to the 6th Century A.D. Waterscape archaeology, a multidisciplinary science devoted to the study of the human use of wetlands and anthropological connection with the water environment, testifies the ways in which people, in the past, constructed and used the water environment. In this article, we describe underwater cultural heritage research using 3D side scan sonar surveys and artifacts analysis, comparing data from direct diving investigations and stratigraphic data from micro-geological drillings on sites of Lago Tramonto, Gambulaga, Portomaggiore (Ferrara).},

In Syriac communities today, one encounters various cultural identity markers that are derived ultimately from ancient Assyria. The chapter begins with a discussion of the use of Assyria and Assyrian in pre-modern Syriac sources. It then looks at how nineteenth-century literature from the West represented Syriac Christians as Assyrian. It is clear from the examples presented in the chapter that the term  æ\=athor\=ay\=a ``Assyrian'' in pre-modern Syriac sources is used in its most basic sense as a gentilic adjective for ancient Assyria and its capital Nineveh. It is in the context of the Anglican Mission to Urmia that East-Syriac Christians likely adopted the term Assyrian as a general self-designation and began to develop a national ideology based on it.},

  abstract = {A survey of Assyrian documentary evidence suggests that the fall of Damascus rep-resented a watershed event for the spread of Arabian commerce and culture to eastern Syria, the Assyrian heartland, and eventually Babylonia. Assyria made and maintained geographic contact with Arabs as a result of Arabian traffic through the intermediate Levant and not by direct routes from Mesopotamia to Dumah or Ha'il. Arabs were evi-dently well established north of the Gilead prior to 732 B.C.E., but were largely restrained from trading farther east until Tiglath-pileser III removed the Aramaean stranglehold. Growing Assyrian familiarity with the characteristic largess of Arabian trade, more-over, coincided with more specific, and probably more austere, tribute impositions on vassal states in Palestine. ARABS AND MESOPOTAMIA: CHRONOLOGY AND TRAJECTORY OF OVERLAND CONTACT cholars have conventionally focused on four main overland commercial arteries for tracing the movement of Arab peoples from the central Arabian Peninsula to Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period.' The two purported principal south-ern routes led northeast around the respective north-ern and southern edges of the Nafud Desert, which itself remains in many respects unnavigable. The first route began in Yathrib (Medina), stopped at Halil in the central peninsula, and terminated in Babylonia either at Ur or the Najaf area south of Babylon. The second route also led to Babylon, with Tayma' and Dumah as its major commercial way-stations. The other two main arteries wound northwestward toward the Gilead basin (the northern area of the so-called King's Highway) and thence through Syria to the Jezireh and Assyria proper. One itinerary featured a pass through the Wadi Sirhan via Tayma' and Du-mah. This route deposited travelers in the Trans-jordanian Gilead near the Amman junction. From there, caravans could pass northward into Syria or through the Beth-shean corridor to the Plain of Akko and yonder Phoenicia. The second option led one either to Elath on the gulf or Mayan in the territory of Edom from either Tayma' or Dedan necessarily by way of inland Tabuk-the coastal terrain being less accommodating to foot traffic by that latitude. These southern caravans could also reach Syria via the King's Highway,2 while others evidently made for the Philistine ports and their goods often for the Mediterranean beyond.3 Medieval Arab writers men-tion an additional route to Amman via Ba'ir, although},

One such mechanism comes into play when the quantitative increase in some entity, usually population, reaching a certain threshold, gives rise to a qualitative change in the structure of a society. This mechanism, first recognized by Hegel, was seized on by Marx and Engels. However, neither they nor their current followers among anthropologists have made much use of it in attempting to explain social evolution. But as this paper attempts to show, in those few instances when the mechanism has been invoked, it has heightened our understanding of the process of social evolution. And, it is argued, if the mechanism were more widely applied, further understanding of the course of evolution could be expected to result.},

To test the method, aerial surveys were conducted at the Chaco-period Blue J community in northwestern New Mexico. Results enable the size and organization of most habitation sites to be readily mapped, and also reveal previously undocumented architectural features.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. Abstract Based on archaeological survey evidence from the Amuq Valley (Turkey), this article explores the settle-ment history of the northern Levant, describing changes in the structural organization of settlement over time. While most of the earliest sites in the region are small and short-lived, beginning ca. 3000 B.C.E., settlement became concentrated at about 100 nucleated tell sites located ex-clusively in lowland plains and river valleys. These towns were continuously or periodically occupied through the Iron Age but were largely abandoned by the Seleucid period. At that time, the city of Antioch was founded in the Amuq Plain, and previously unoccupied highlands be-came densely populated by small farmsteads and villages. This phase of settlement reached a peak in late antiquity but was followed by a progressive abandonment during the Early and Middle Islamic periods. Local historical evidence, including the Middle-Late Bronze Age Alalakh texts and Late Roman writings of Libanius, sheds light on some of the social forces, such as institutions of land ten-ure and the organization of the agricultural economy, that likely contributed to the formation and durability of these distinctly different settlement systems. Results challenge traditional views of settlement in the northern Levant and highlight some of the most significant transformations in the organization of the cultural landscape.*},

Arguing instead for the critically important role of a human analyst in archaeological discovery, I illustrate interim results of an ongoing project that utilizes CORONA satellite imagery to document previously unknown sites in a 300,000 km 2 study area in the northern Fertile Crescent. The project is based on what I term ``brute force'' methods, relying on systematic exploration of imagery by trained analysts, and has now successfully created a database of more than 14,000 sites, some 10,000 of which are previously undocumented. Results of the project highlight the need for human intervention to make any archaeological discovery meaningful, suggesting that imagery analysis, like any act of archaeological investigation, requires an engaged, thoughtful and creative scholar.},

Clearly, the cultural heritage of Syria and surrounding regions is being impacted in sometimes extreme ways through military activity, looting, and ideologicallymotivated destruction.

In recent years, different vegetation indices and several other image features have been used, with varying success, to improve the interpretation of remotely sensed images for archaeological research. However, it is difficult to assess the derived maps quantitatively and select the most meaningful one for a given task, in particular for a non-specialist in image processing. This paper estimates for the first time objectively the suitability of maps derived from spectral features for the detection of buried archaeological structures in vegetated areas based on information theory. This is achieved by computing the statistical dependence between the extracted features and a digital map indicating the presence of buried structures using information theoretical notions. Based on the obtained scores on known targets, the features can be ranked and the most suitable can be chosen to aid in the discovery of previously undetected crop marks in the area under similar conditions. Three case studies are reported: the Roman buried remains of Carnuntum (Austria), the underground structures of Selinunte in the South of Italy, and the buried street relics of Pherai (Velestino) in central Greece.},

  abstract = {Medieval European urbanization presents a line of continuity between earlier cities and modern European urban systems. Yet, many of the spatial, political and economic features of medieval European cities were particular to the Middle Ages, and subsequently changed over the Early Modern Period and Industrial Revolution. There is a long tradition of demographic studies estimating the population sizes of medieval European cities, and comparative analyses of these data have shed much light on the long-term evolution of urban systems. However, the next step\textemdash to systematically relate the population size of these cities to their spatial and socioeconomic characteristics\textemdash has seldom been taken. This raises a series of interesting questions, as both modern and ancient cities have been observed to obey area-population relationships predicted by settlement scaling theory. To address these questions, we analyze a new dataset for the settled area and population of 173 European cities from the early fourteenth century to determine the relationship between population and settled area. To interpret this data, we develop two related models that lead to differing predictions regarding the quantitative form of the population-area relationship, depending on the level of social mixing present in these cities. Our empirical estimates of model parameters show a strong densification of cities with city population size, consistent with patterns in contemporary cities. Although social life in medieval Europe was orchestrated by hierarchical institutions (e.g., guilds, church, municipal organizations), our results show no statistically significant influence of these institutions on agglomeration effects. The similarities between the empirical patterns of settlement relating area to population observed here support the hypothesis that cities throughout history share common principles of organization that self-consistently relate their socioeconomic networks to structured urban spaces.},

Many scientists have tried to derive the rank-size scaling relation through entropy-maximizing methods, but they have not been entirely successful. By introducing a pivotal constraint condition, I present here a set of new derivations based on the self-similar hierarchy of cities. First, I derive a pair of exponent laws by postulating local entropy maximizing. From the two exponential laws follows a general hierarchical scaling law, which implies the general form of Zipf's law. Second, I derive a special hierarchical scaling law with the exponent equal to 1 by postulating global entropy maximizing, and this implies the pure form of Zipf's law. The rank-size scaling law has proven to be one of the special cases of the hierarchical scaling law, and the derivation suggests a certain scaling range with the first or the last data point as an outlier. The entropy maximization of social systems differs from the notion of entropy increase in thermodynamics. For urban systems, entropy maximizing suggests the greatest equilibrium between equity for parts/individuals and efficiency of the whole. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using a realist/postpositivist paradigm, an evaluative approach, and a framework of job satisfaction, this project has explored and compared the views of ECRs to evaluate the factors which shape the ECR experience and contribute to job satisfaction or dissatisfaction and intention to leave, and to define the features which are necessary to keep an ECR in research.Data collection for this mixed methods study entailed a national survey of researchers working in universities and research institutes (n=658), a focus group discussion and semistructured in-depth interviews with eight women from a variety of scientific disciplines who had recently left academic research workplaces. I focussed particularly on the difficulties consequent to job insecurity: the constant need to attracting funding and a permanent position, lack of work-life balance and associated stress; and evidence of workplace difficulties such as bullying, harassment or inequity and support \textendash{} or lack of it \textendash{} offered by the research institutions. I examined the factors which contribute to and barriers which prevent job satisfaction of this population, and the consequent intention (if any) for ECRs to leave research or change their career path.I found an interesting situation whereby the satisfaction derived from a ``love of science'' was counterbalanced by stress and poor working conditions which are a consequence of lack of job security, typified by poor supervision, bullying or harassment, inequitable hiring practices, a concerning rate of impact from ``questionable research practices'' (impacting 34\%-41\% of respondents) and evidence of very high (80\%) intention of ECRs to leave their position. The most significant predictor of intention to leave is time as a postdoctoral scientist: eventually the job insecurity and its associated stresses become toomuch and the ECRs leave their chosen career for work elsewhere. This decision, too, provides interesting findings as many of the ECRs have difficulty planning what to do next. They feel ill-prepared for an alternate career and suffer from a sense of failure as a result of having to leave academia.While addressing the shortage of funding is outside the scope of this study, in addition to offering my findings I put forward a range of recommendations which could lead to a change of culture and benefit the wellbeing of ECRs in STEMM without incurring significant cost.The Australian Government, higher education institutions and the research community need to improve job security and workplace conditions and take better care of our people in STEMM disciplines or we will not have the scientists we need to deliver the ``innovative Australia'' planned for 2030 (Department of Industry Innovation and Science, 2018).},

The examples, drawn from late prehistoric and Bronze Age societies that developed at the onset of urbanization, show how small communities might respond to various resource stresses and environmental fluctuations. The computer simulations demonstrate that some households gain resources at the expense of others and the community becomes more economically differentiated through time with some households benefiting at the expense of others. The approaches discussed demonstrate that complex societies were capable of a wide range of responses to stresses that could be absorbed or amplified via a number of social, economic, or demographic processes.},

Syrian urban policies in the 2000s set the issue of informal settlements as a priority item in the agenda. The reform of the legislative urban frameworks, designed with international assistance, and new master plans encouraged both their regularization / upgrading and their renewal (destruction / reconstruction). While competition between these models and objectives delayed decisions and program implementation in Damascus, the beginnings of the Arab Spring elsewhere in the region influenced the orientation of these policies, showing in which different ways urban planning can be used for strategic reasons. Initially, the Syrian uprising led to an inflexion of policies towards more social options for regularization. Subsequently, as it developed into an armed conflict, and with the escalation of physical destructions, the urban renewal option was favoured and overlapped military targets. In return, conflict, destruction and displacements have led to put all urban options back on the table for reconsideration, in the prospects of future reconstruction. This article discusses policies towards informal settlements in Syria before and during the uprising with a special focus on the case study of urban policies in the metropolitan area of Damascus.},

The impressive hydraulic system built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib is composed by different archaeological areas, displaced along the Land of Nineveh, in Iraqi Kurdistan. The extensive project we are working on has the aim of mapping and geo-referencing any kind of documentation in order to design an archaeological-environmental park able to preserve and enhance the archaeological complex. Unfortunately, the area is failing a topographic documentation and the available cartography is not sufficient for planning and documentation purposes. The research work presented in these pages moves towards this direction, by exploiting Pleiad\'es Very High Resolution (VHR) images (in both nadir and stereo configuration) for an accurate mapping of the site. In more depth, Pleiad\'es nadir VHR images have been used to perform a pansharpening procedure used to enhance the visual interpretation of the study area, whilst stereo-pair have been processed to produce the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area. Statistical evaluations show the high accuracy of the processing and the reliability of the outputs as well. The integration of different products, at different Levels of Detail within a unique GIS environment, besides protecting, preserving and enhancing the water system of Sennacherib's, paves the way to allow the Kurdistan Regional Government to present a proposal for the admission of the archaeological complex in the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List (WHTL).},

It discusses sites located in the region surrounding the ancient city on both east and west banks of the river Euphrates and seeks to identify the principal roads of the region used in antiquity. Maps to complement those prepared for the preceding article are included.In Comfort et al 2000, ancient crossing points of the river Euphrates in southern Turkey were discussed in the light of survey work conducted with the help of satellite photos in and around the reservoir created by the Birecik dam. This dam was completed in summer 2000. The lake created behind the Birecik dam stretches north about 100km as far as the Atat\"urk dam, for the most part constrained in a narrow gorge; a second lake now also reaches for about 20km south from Birecik to the Carchemish dam, itself approximately 6km north of the Syrian border. The survey was conducted over six visits between 1996 and 1999. Given the shortage of resources and the vast area covered (about 2,500km) it can only be considered a preliminary investigation and was indeed originally undertaken with a view only to proving the usefulness of satellite photographs as an aid to archaeological survey work.},

In order to analyse this dataset we used a GIS-based approach, modelling the Lycian road system by the meaning of a Cost Distance and Least Cost Paths modelling procedure. This case study can provide an example of both advantages and intrinsic theoretical and technical problems of using raster cost surfaces and a LCP's-based procedure as an explanatory model in archaeology.},

  abstract = {Four thousand years ago what is often considered to be the world's first empire, the Akkadian Empire, collapsed. Proxy data has suggested a regional aridification event coincided with this collapse, but there is a lack of records collected from within the Mesopotamian region, where the Akkadian Empire was based. Here we analyse a suite of simulations from the HadCM3 climate model covering the last 6000 years. The results show that long-term drivers produced a shift to a more arid climate, showing minima in both precipitation and river flow at 2000 BCE, whilst temperatures were colder at 2250 BCE. These changes were sufficient to have a negative impact on the natural vegetation in Mesopotamia, suggesting that this climate change would have also impacted the agriculture sustaining local communities. We suggest that the combined effects of climate change and land mismanagement would lead to shortages of water and food, which may have contributed to social disruption and the collapse of the Akkadian Empire. We also find examples of resilience through the surviving cities such as Tell Brak and Tell Mozan. These could provide lessons for adapting to climate change in the future, as modern-day climate change threatens food and water security.},

That record is here put to use to interrogate changing settlement patterns in the north-eastern corner of Tokyo Bay during several millennia of the Jomon period (Early, Middle and Late Jomon: 7000\textendash 3220 cal BP). Jomon hunter-gatherer occupation is characterised by large numbers of settlements, some of them substantial in size, containing hundreds of individual pit-house residential units. Detailed analysis of the rank-size distribution of these settlements reveals a pattern in which periods of settlement clumping, with few large settlements, alternate with more dispersed settlement patterns on a regular cycle of approximately 600 years. The regularity of this cycle might suggest a correlation with cycles of climatic change, such as Bond events. Closer scrutiny shows, however, that such a correlation is unconvincing and suggests that cyclical change in Jomon settlement patterns may instead be due to other factors.},

  abstract = {The increasing damage to archaeological sites is of particular issue in the Near East.  Rapid modernisation has dramatically changed the landscape, threatening the archaeological resource.  Ancient sites and relict landscapes are particularly well preserved here, but the rate of anthropogenic damage is shown to be increasing markedly.  This primary aim of this thesis is to use sequential satellite images to examine the changes to archaeological sites in selected case study areas in Syria, and attempt a quantitative assessment.  Results are then generalised to the wider Middle Eastern region.  The secondary aim is to demonstrate the potential of low cost and free satellite imagery for archaeological site monitoring, as such work is essential but the cost of custom-ordered imagery is prohibitive for many organisations. The case study areas were Tell Beydar in the Upper Khabur Basin, and the region south of Carchemish by the Euphrates.  161 sites were examined, first on low-cost Corona imagery from the 1960s, showing sites at the advent of the landscape change, and then on SPOT, DigitalGlobe and Geoeye imagery from the last decade, available through Google Earth.  The sites were surveyed as part of Durham University's Fragile Crescent Project, and the survey records used to inform the analysis.  Some level of assessment was possible on all sites. The concept of damage was examined and refined, and then applied to the case study sites.  Multiple anthropogenic threats were examined, and all were quantitatively shown to be increasing in horizontal extent across sites and vertical depth in both case study areas, often causing extensive damage.  Almost no sites were unaffected.  Finally, key issues from this study are highlighted and key recommendations made.},

The precipitation shows a decreasing trend with 1980s being wetter and 2000s being drier. A total of 55 and 40\% reduction in high flows in Tigris and Euphrates rivers at T20 and E3 was seen in post-reservoir period. A lag time of 3 to 4 and 5 to 6 months was estimated between peak snowfall and runoff time periods. Decreasing precipitation and streamflow along with several planned dams could hamper the sustainability of several Mesopotamian marshlands that completely depend on the water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.},

Moreover examining the political development of the Lebanese Shi'a community in relation to education is not an issue that has captured much scholarly attention. Therefore, this study pictures political-educational strategies employed by a religious group, the Shi'a of Lebanon, as a conscious tool to obtain greater share of the economic and political power which has been held in large measure by the nation's dominant group, the Christians.

  abstract = {Sources of information on how Assyrians conducted wars include cuneiform texts of various kinds on stone and clay, stone panels carved in low relief, cylinder seals, and various kinds of excavated material. At the beginning of the first millennium (Iron Age) the Neo-Assyrian army inherited from its predecessors a warrior ethic based on elite chariotry, a system of provincial governors who raised local levies, and reliance on mass deportation to break up centers of resistance. The new developments consist of the gradual introduction of iron for weaponry and armor, and the increasing use of cavalry which eventually relegated chariotry to a mainly ceremonial role, perhaps as early as the reign of Sargon II. Siege warfare is the subject of several groups of bas-relief panels, of which one of the largest shows Sennacherib's siege of Lachish in Judah. Bas-reliefs show that temporary military camps were carefully designed with tents and collapsible furniture.},

As part of this mission, ASOR CHI, through a public\textendash government collaboration with the United States of America (US) Department of State, has been provided with access to hundreds of thousands of satellite images, some within 24 h of the image being taken, in order to assess reports of damage to cultural heritage sites, to discover unreported damage, and to evaluate the impacts of such incidents. This work is being done across an inventory of over 13,000 cultural heritage sites in the affected regions. The available dataset of satellite imagery is significantly larger than the scales that geospatial specialists within archaeology have dealt with in the past. This has necessitated a rethinking of how the project uses satellite imagery and how ASOR CHI and future projects can more effectively undertake the important work of cultural heritage monitoring and damage assessment.},

The model addresses factors that make locations attractive for trade and settlement, affecting settlement growth and change. We explore why some sites become relatively major settlements, while others diminish in the periods discussed. We assess how political and geographic constraints affect regional settlement transformations, while also accounting for uncertainty in the archaeological data. Model outputs indicate how the MBA settlement pattern contrasts from the IA for the same region when different factors affecting settlement size importance, facility of movement, and exogenous site interactions are studied. The results suggest the importance of political and historical factors in these periods and also demonstrate the value of a quantitative model in explaining emergent settlement size distributions across landscapes affected by different socio-environmental causal elements. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {nullTell Aswad, in the Damascus basin, was settled by a community offarmers and huniers from early VIIIth Millennium (ca. 7800 BC) to mid VIIth Millennium.\textbackslash nLithic industries seem located both on typological and geographical grounds in a transitional position between those from Palestine and Middle Euphrates. Basai Aswad I shows both in its flaking techniques (naviform cores, crested blades) and in its sickles types features in common with Mureybet III, which shall only reach Palestine during PPNB, thus confirming the mainly Syrian origin ofthe latter. Notched arrowheads types (with deep basai notches) and their survival later than on the Euphrates already show evidence however of some westward links. These increase notably in VIIth Millennium Aswad II, with typological types (Jericho and Amuq points) which shall only reach the Euphrates much later or not at all.\textbackslash nVegetable remains from Tell Aswad point to plant cultivation from the beginning of the site on. Triticum dicoccum, Lens culinaris and Pisum sativum are among earliest crop plants. It is not certain wether in the early stages of habitation barley was grown intentionally. Triticum cf. durum, Triticum monococcum and Hordeum nudum did not arrive at Aswad until after 7300 BC. The possibility of the exploitation of surface water for agricultural purposes is discussed. Interpreting Tell Aswad's pollen analysis suggests assumptions regarding soil exploitation patterns, such as rotating crops, threshing and winnowing.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nTell Aswad, dans le bassin de Damas, fut habit\'e par un groupe d'agriculteurs chasseurs du d\'ebut du VIIIe Mill\'enaire (ca. 7800 av. J.-C.) au milieu du VIIe Mill\'enaire.\textbackslash nLes industries lithiques paraissent occuper typologiquement autant que g\'eographiquement une place interm\'ediaire entre celles de Palestine et du Moyen Euphrate. D\`es l'origine, Aswad I poss\`ede par ses techniques de taille (nucleus naviformes, lames \`a cr\^ete) et par ses types de faucilles des caract\`eres communs avec Mureybet III, qui ne gagneront la Palestine qu'au PPNB, confirmant l'origine pour une grande part syrienne de ce dernier. Les types de fl\`eches \`a encoches (\`a ailerons r\'ecurrents) et leur persistance plus longue que sur l'Euphrate y t\'emoignent cependant d\'ej\`a de quelques affinit\'es occidentales. Celles-ci s'accentuent au VIIe Mill\'enaire dans Aswad II, dont la typologie inclut des types (pointes de J\'ericho ou d'Amouq) qui n'atteignent l'Euphrate que tardivement ou pas du tout.\textbackslash nLes restes v\'eg\'etaux de Tell Aswad attestent l'agriculture d\`es la fondation du site. Triticum dicoccum, Lens culinaris et Pisum sativum sont parmi les plus anciennes plantes cultiv\'ees. La culture de l'orge n'est pas assur\'ee aux premi\`eres \'etapes de l'occupation. Triticum cf. durum, Triticum monococcum et Hordeum nudum ne sont attest\'es \`a Aswad qu'\`a partir de 7300 av. J.-C. La possibilit\'e de l'utilisation des eaux superficielles pour l'agriculture est envisag\'ee. L'interpr\'etation de l'analyse pollinique, pour sa part, sugg\`ere des hypoth\`eses sur les modes d'exploitation du sol, tels que rotation des cultures, techniques de battage et de vannage.},

  abstract = {Khandaq Shapur has been named one of the great barriers of the ancient world, but very little is known about the monumental-scale linear feature. This interdisciplinary paper brings together archaeologists and historians to present (1) an updated history of the Khandaq Shapur drawing upon a wider range of sources, including Arabic scholarly sources, and (2) a modern map of the Khandaq Shapur produced from a ground truthed remote sensing using historic Corona satellite imagery from the 1960s and imagery available in Google Earth. This new map of the Khandaq Shapur's ground truthed location is compared to the known locations of Sasanian sites from previous archaeological surveys to contextualise the Khandaq Shapur within the wider archaeological landscape. Together, the landscape archaeology and historical evidence provide a comprehensive picture of this unique feature: shedding light not only on its precise location, but also its nature (what was it?) and how it was used over time.},

  abstract = {Incision by the River Euphrates has created a dramatic erosional landscape in the northern Arabian Platform in SE Turkey. We obtain accurate heights of its terrace deposits in the Birecik area using differential GPS, and summarise evidence regarding heights of Late Miocene basalt flows and low-altitude wetland sediments. We thus estimate {$\sim$}600 m of uplift since the early Late Miocene ({$\sim$}9 Ma), represented by {$\sim$}270 m of fluvial incision, the difference reflecting downstream channel-lengthening as the coastline has retreated to the Persian Gulf, {$\sim$}1400 km away. The oldest recognised sediments, inset below this level, form a thick aggradation between {$\sim$}100 and {$\sim$}130 m above the present level of the Euphrates. We estimate that this accumulated during {$\sim$}5-3 Ma when uplift rates were low, such that aggradation was necessary to maintain a downstream channel gradient in response to the coastal retreat. Palaeolithic artefacts have been reported locally in Euphrates deposits up to {$\sim$}80 m above present river level, which we tentatively date to {$\sim$}1.8 Ma. The Euphrates subsequently incised to within {$\sim$}10 m of its present level before aggrading {$\sim$}45 m higher in the late Early Pleistocene. The final {$\sim$}55 m of incision reflects the increase in uplift rates observed worldwide in the early Middle Pleistocene, following the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

In the highlands of Papua New Guinea, large-scale and extensive wetland agricultural practices date from several thousand years ago up to the present. These extensive drainage networks are the product of collective, community-based action and are co-ordinated by the persuasive influence of relatively weak and egalitarian political leaders, big-men (Strathern 1971). Here the New Guinea evidence is used to critique evolutionary models of societal development and associated concepts of human nature to develop a mutualistic perspective on the past. These ideas are pertinent to contemporary highland societies, many of which aggressively maintain their independence from each other and the Papua New Guinea state. Their agricultural history continues as a living tradition into the present.},

Though the ethics of participation in archaeological contexts have been defined (and refined) over the life of the discipline, the emergence of digital technologies as tools, and the centering of digital methodologies in archaeology have created new areas requiring ethical consideration. The adoption of discipline-wide standards of digital archaeological ethics has been slow, and the output of digitally centered archaeological data and published products has outpaced ethical discussion and implementation of ethical guidelines. The result is a generation of archaeologists who are versed in digital forms, but whose work is ungrounded in consensus-led ethical frameworks that explicitly reference the digital.

This multimillenary city bears an exceptional testimony to the beginnings of the Phoenician civilization. The site covers an area of 10~ha located along the coast. The present paper deals with the synthetic mapping of the archaeological site and its environment using remote sensing techniques. Very high-resolution imagery is vital for monitoring any archaeological site in its widest context. In the specific case of Byblos, the comparison of the Orbview 3, Ikonos 2 and Geo-Eye 1digital data indicates that a spatial resolution of about half-a-meter is necessary for archaeological purposes and particularly for mapping the walls and the buildings. The use of Corona archive acquired in 1970 allows mapping the archaeological site and its coastal environment before the Lebanese civil war. This multitemporal approach allows us to evaluate the sensitivity of the archaeological site to external factors, such as the coastal erosion, the cliff degradation, and the urban growth. It also helps to better plan the improvement of the site for touristic purposes.},

After discussing some of the problems this can cause, I describe a way of characterizing past settlement dynamics and a method for estimating (1) the mean number of likely simultaneous occupations for a region and (2) phase-to-phase differences in mean occupation span.

The research also provided important data concerning the reconstruction of the surrounding landscape, where a lot of traces of old channels and riverbeds of the Euphrates were identified in areas much modified and altered during the last decades by urbanization and agricultural works.

  abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important component of many coastal environments and hydrologic processes, providing sources of nutrients to marine ecosystems, and potentially, an important source of fresh water for human populations. Here, we use a combination of unpiloted aerial systems (UAS) thermal infrared (TIR) imaging and salinity measurements to characterize SGD on the remote East Polynesian island of Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile). Previous research has shown that coastal freshwater seeps are abundant on Rapa Nui and strongly associated with the locations of ancient settlement sites. We currently lack, however, information on the differential magnitude or quality of these sources of fresh water. Our UAS-based TIR results from four locations on Rapa Nui suggest that locations of variably-sized SGD plumes are associated with many ancient settlement sites on the island and that these water sources are resilient to drought events. These findings support previous work indicating that ancient Rapa Nui communities responded to the inherent and climate-induced hydrological challenges of the island by focusing on these abundant and resilient freshwater sources. Our results highlight the efficacy of using UAS-based TIR for detecting relatively small SGD locations and provide key insights on the potential uses of these water sources for past and current Rapa Nui communities.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of underwater topography is essential to the understanding of the organisation and distribution of archaeological sites along and in water bodies. Special attention has to be paid to intertidal and inshore zones where, due to sea-level rise, coastlines have changed and many former coastal sites are now submerged in shallow water. Mapping the detailed inshore topography is therefore important to reconstruct former coastlines, identify sunken archaeological structures and locate potential former harbour sites. However, until recently archaeology has lacked suitable methods to provide the required topographical data of shallow underwater bodies. Our research shows that airborne topo-bathymetric laser scanner systems are able to measure surfaces above and below the water table over large areas in high detail using very short and narrow green laser pulses, even revealing sunken archaeological structures in shallow water. Using an airborne laser scanner operating at a wavelength in the green visible spectrum (532 nm) two case study areas in different environmental settings (Kolone, Croatia, with clear sea water; Lake Keutschach, Austria, with turbid water) were scanned. In both cases, a digital model of the underwater topography with a planimetric resolution of a few decimeters was measured. While in the clear waters of Kolone penetration depth was up to 11 meters, turbid Lake Keutschach allowed only to document the upper 1.6 meters of its underwater topography. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technique to map submerged archaeological structures over large areas in high detail providing the possibility for systematic, large scale archaeological investigation of this environment.},

A coefficient of shape is proposed to facilitate comparison and to serve as a basis for bootstrap assessment of statistical confidence in any differences that are observed.

  abstract = {The Qingjiang River Basin, which is 423 km long in the Hubei province, China, is the first large tributary of the Yangtze River below the Three Gorges. The Qingjiang River Basin surface water area monitoring plays an important role in the water resource management strategy and regular monitoring management of the Yangtze River watershed. Hydropower cascade exploitation, which started in 1987, has formed three reservoirs including the Geheyan reservoir, the Gaobazhou reservoir, and the Shuibuya reservoir in the midstream and downstream of the Qingjiang River Basin. They have made a great impact on surface water area changes of the Qingjiang River Basin and need to be taken into account. We monitor the Qingjiang River Basin surface water area changes from 1973 to 2010. Ten scenes from the Multispectral Scanner System (MSS), seven scenes from the Thematic Mapper (TM), and two scenes from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETMP) remote sensing data of Landsat satellites, the normalized different water index (NDWI), the modified NDWI (MNDWI), and Otsu image segmentation method were employed to quantitatively estimate the Qingjiang River Basin surface water area in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively. The results indicate that the surface water area of the Qingjiang River Basin shows a growing trend with the hydropower cascade development from the 1980s to the first decade of the 21st century. The study concluded the significance of human activities impact on surface water spatiotemporal distribution. Surface water accretion is significant in most parts of the Qingjiang River Basin and might be related to the constructed cascade hydropower dams. \textcopyright{} 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

This paper evaluates the potential of the recent Landsat satellite (Landsat-8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral images for LSWM using three NDWI models. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the three OLI NDWI models in the Yangtze River Basin and the Huaihe River Basin in China. The results demonstrate that the three OLI NDWI models achieve an overall accuracy of more than 95\%, a kappa coefficient of 0.89 and a producers accuracy of 95\% for LSWM. The results also demonstrate that the NDWI model using the green band (Band 3) and the SWIR1 band (Band 6) (referred to as NDWIO6,3) of the OLI sensor has a higher LSWM accuracy than the other two NDWI models.},

  abstract = {Monitoring open water bodies accurately is an important and basic application in remote sensing. Various water body mapping approaches have been developed to extract water bodies from multispectral images. The method based on the spectral water index, especially the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MDNWI) calculated from the green and Shortwave-Infrared (SWIR) bands, is one of the most popular methods. The recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite can provide fine spatial resolution multispectral images. This new dataset is potentially of important significance for regional water bodies' mapping, due to its free access and frequent revisit capabilities. It is noted that the green and SWIR bands of Sentinel-2 have different spatial resolutions of 10 m and 20 m, respectively. Straightforwardly, MNDWI can be produced from Sentinel-2 at the spatial resolution of 20 m, by upscaling the 10-m green band to 20 m correspondingly. This scheme, however, wastes the detailed information available at the 10-m resolution. In this paper, to take full advantage of the 10-m information provided by Sentinel-2 images, a novel 10-m spatial resolution MNDWI is produced from Sentinel-2 images by downscaling the 20-m resolution SWIR band to 10 m based on pan-sharpening. Four popular pan-sharpening algorithms, including Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS), High Pass Filter (HPF) and \`a Trous Wavelet Transform (ATWT), were applied in this study. The performance of the proposed method was assessed experimentally using a Sentinel-2 image located at the Venice coastland. In the experiment, six water indexes, including 10-m NDWI, 20-m MNDWI and 10-m MNDWI, produced by four pan-sharpening algorithms, were compared. Three levels of results, including the sharpened images, the produced MNDWI images and the finally mapped water bodies, were analysed quantitatively. The results showed that MNDWI can enhance water bodies and suppressbuilt-up features more efficiently than NDWI. Moreover, 10-m MNDWIs produced by all four pan-sharpening algorithms can represent more detailed spatial information of water bodies than 20-m MNDWI produced by the original image. Thus, MNDWIs at the 10-m resolution can extract more accurate water body maps than 10-m NDWI and 20-m MNDWI. In addition, although HPF can produce more accurate sharpened images and MNDWI images than the other three benchmark pan-sharpening algorithms, the ATWT algorithm leads to the best 10-m water bodies mapping results. This is no necessary positive connection between the accuracy of the sharpened MNDWI image and the map-level accuracy of the resultant water body maps.},

  abstract = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice., To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension., We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections: , , The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques., To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique., Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost students' performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading)., Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research.},

One of the main challenges facing the sustainable development of Egypt is the need for better management of its limited fresh water resources. Groundwater exists in the Nile Valley, Nile Delta, Western Desert Oases, and Sinai Peninsula. Hydrogeological mapping of groundwater resources is one of the main tools for the controlled development of groundwater resources. Remotely sensed surface indicators of groundwater provide useful data where practical classical alternatives are not available. Integrated remote sensing and GIS are widely used in groundwater mapping. Locating potential groundwater targets is becoming more convenient, cost effective than invasive methods and efficient with the advent of a number of satellite imagery. The nature of remote sensing-based groundwater exploration is to delineate all possible features connected with localization of groundwater. Data, driven out of remote sensing, support decisions related to sustainable development and groundwater management.},

  abstract = {Egyptian civilization has long flourished along the banks of the Nile, in the south (e.g. Luxor and Aswan), the Middle (e.g. Giza `Great Pyramids') and North (e.g. San El-Hagar and Buto), as well as the less populated areas of the Sinai Peninsula, the Western Desert and the Red Sea coast. There are archaeological sites date back to the Palaeolithic period and cover the Pre-dynastic, Pharaonic, Hellenistic-Roman, Coptic and Muslim periods. Across the Nile Delta, many of these archaeological sites have disappeared beneath Nile alluvium from the annual inundation or through intensive agricultural use, climate changes and other anthropogenic activities. This study aims to detect the long-term changes in the landscape of the archaeological area of Burullus on the Mediterranean shoreline in the North Delta of Egypt. By combining data from historic topographic maps with Radar Sentinel-1 (High-resolution Level-1 GRD) and SRTM data, topographic signatures in satellite imagery can be compared with the historic record of archaeological sites, many of which are now lost. Image layering, enhancement and analysis using ENVI 5.1, ArcMap 10.4.1 and Snap 8.0 software as well as Google Earth Pro facilitated the imagery identification and acquisition. The results of this study provide a means of quantifying the significant loss of cultural heritage sites due to anthropogenic and natural changes in the landscape. This analysis has also identified two\textemdash previously unknown\textemdash potential archaeological sites. Finally, the reconstruction of the paleolandscape of the study area shows the changing relationships of ancient and historic settlements with natural and man-made waterways over time. Integrating remote sensing data and historic maps offers a method for evaluating paleolandscapes and locating disappeared archaeological sites that can be applied in other areas of Egypt and the world.},

  abstract = {More than 80 per cent of the world's landscapes are influenced significantly by human activities, and current land-use and land cover trends are likely to increase the rate of landscape change at a significant rate in the near future. To manage and guide landscape change, and an advocacy of positive landscape change \textendash{} rather than attempts to stop change as in traditional preservationist approaches \textendash{} requires the identification of threats and opportunities. Tools to do this will need to be based on well-investigated evidence for the long-term past evolution of landscapes and the understanding of possible future scenarios for change. Historic landscape characterisation (HLC) is a GIS-based method employed to interpret and study landscapes with a particular focus on representing and mapping the aspects of landscape character which result from past cultural processes. This paper introduces a new protocol which uses HLC data to model future landscape evolution and to simulate scenarios of landscape change. It describes a computer-based simulation framework derived from landscape ecology and used with HLC datasets during research on a region in southern Turkey. Such integrated modelling protocols have the potential to assist landscape planners to develop holistic and informative approaches to managing landscape change.},

  abstract = {Mesopotamia is well known as one of the areas where intensive irrigated agriculture provided the food for early cities to develop. As people diverted river water to the land to grow food crops, populations became denser, and politics, arts, and culture thrived. Less well known perhaps is the fact that in the downstream region of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, what is today southern Iraq, an extensive wetland provided the resources for the development of a large community near or in the marshes. This region received unfortu-nate attention in the early 1990s, when in an attempt to defeat opposition to his rule, Sadam Hussein ordered the marshes to be drained. Currently, a large-scale restoration project by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) called ''Support for Environmental Management of the Iraqi Marshland'' is attempting to restore the wetlands and develop the necessary management procedures. From the 1990s to the present, political discourse on Iraq has linked Hussein's Iraqi government to weapons of mass destruction. In the booklet Wetlands of mass destruction: Ancient presage for contemporary ecocide in southern Iraq, Robert Lawrence France draws upon this same language to address the marshes. The product of a 2004 workshop at Harvard University on the marshes, the booklet includes several papers describing the recent struggles of the marshland peoples and possible ways in which to support them now and in future. While preparing for the workshop, France delved into existing historical literature on the region and was ''struck by the seemingly prophetic nature of much of the historic material'' (p3). Although he acknowledges that one cannot simply use the texts of many years ago as a direct link to recent events, he includes them alongside the workshop papers. The result is rather fascinating. Texts of different times and genres, from ancient inscriptions to modern speeches, can be read in tandem. While there may not be direct links between the recent events and the ancient texts, what is clear from both is that the river and marshes are of vital importance for human survival. It is not surprising then that the water system became a source of power and a tool of power. Draining the marshes or},

  abstract = {In order to use the energy and irrigation potential of the Euphrates River, a series of dams have been designed (upstream to downstream); Keban, Karakaya, Karababa (Ataturk), Birecik and Karkamis. The first three of these dams have been completed; construction on the Birecik and Karkamis dams is underway. The initial plans involved a 60 m high Golkoy dam, downstream of the Karakaya dam, with the Ataturk dam 60 m lower than it is currently. In the belief that the cost of irrigation by the Ataturk dam's water would be high, the increase of the height of Ataturk dam was preferred to the construction of the Golkoy dam. The Keban dam's basement is formed by karstic rock, named Keban marble. From the author and his colleagues' studies, it has been shown that water would leak from the left side of Keban dam reservoir, forming a spring in the Keban Creek. In order to prevent this water leakage, an intensive grouting programme was applied. In spite of this, when the reservoir was filled, 26-30 m3/s of water leaked from the Keban Creek. A more recent study on the volume of leakage showed it to be reduced to 7-8 m3/s, with this amount remaining constant. The Karakaya dam is constructed on metamorphic rocks thus only allowing minimal water leakage. However, on the downstream side of the right slope, the Tillo-Bego-Senketo landslides have been an important risk to the dam. If such landslides cause an artificial lake by blocking the Euphrates River, the Karakaya hydroelectric power station could be flooded. Limestone forms the foundations for the Ataturk dam. On and around the damsite, there is epithermal water (24-26\textdegree C) below the aquifer, deeper than 300 m, with the level of the grouting curtain down to 180-200 m. The grouting curtain would not be able to prevent the leakage because the level of karstification extends below the grouting curtain. In February 1993, the total volume of leaking water from the damsite and its vicinity reached 10 m3/s when the reservoir level was 517 m. When the reservoir is full (542 m), the volume of leaking water is expected to increase. Under the clay core of the dam, extending from the surface to 30-40 m depth, high grouting pressure could not be applied, so water leaked at this part of the grouting curtain and thus the amount of leaked water could not be measured.},

We highlight the rapid development of urban primacy in southern Mesopotamia's heartland (Adams 1981) and the more static rural integration of the Diyala hinterland (Adams 1965). In contrast, Bronze Age urbanization in the southern Levant describes a mosaic of urban and rural systems following independent trajectories. We call for greater attention to small sites, which often define the shape of rank-size distributions. Our approach illuminates modest cases of urbanization in terms of structure, rather than simply of reduced scale, and avoids a tendency to categorize such cases as derivative.},

  abstract = {This is the second of three planned articles on ethnicity in the Assyrian empire, with ethnicity involving the identification of group identities and/or differentiations on the basis of mutual contact, as observed from the protagonists' viewpoint or from that of the surrounding social order, along the Barthian model. On a documentary basis, the Assyrian empire lends itself in a unique manner as observation point for the study of the mechanisms of ethnicity in the ancient Near Eastern context. The article focuses, like the others, on the study of ``ethnic-group terms'' as identifiers of ethnicity within the Neo-Assyrian period, and specifically on those terms to which the "gentilic" suffix (nisbe) was applied. The particular theme chosen for this article regards the ethnic-group term "Assyrian" (A\v{s}\v{s}ur\=ayu and other designations) as utilized in both official (royal) inscriptions and "everyday" (or state archival) documents from the Neo-Assyrian empire. The attempt is to bring forth the flexibility, and even at times the ambiguity, of the definition that the Assyrians offered of themselves in different official or discursive contexts, as well as in the light of diachronical variations and shifts. After a lengthy overview of the sources, it may be concluded that the "everyday" and official documents differ in their definition of "Assyrians", due to chronological, compositional, and contextual factors involving the two textual corpora. Although some ranges of meanings of A\v{s}\v{s}ur\=ayu or its synonyms show overlaps between them, only the state archival texts indicate "Assyrians" as members of the \'elite classes of the Empire, entitled to professional and juridical privileges on the basis of the king's favor; whereas the royal inscriptions are unique in pointing out the king's role as rescuer of poor "Assyrians" who had been left stranded or who had lost their possessions abroad. Summing up, a decided pride/relish in inborn/inbred group particularities, combined with a proactive (and ultimately optimistic) impulse to expand "Assyrian- ness" through the addition of external personnel to the commonwealth, characterize in a singular manner the Assyrians among ancient Mesopotamian peoples.},

In this text, I argue that articles written and peer-reviewed by scholars should not be merchandises to trade, but knowledge commons to share with everyone and to preserve for future generations. Today, electronic publishing allows this change of paradigm, but most scientific publishers prefer to keep the business model of printing which benefits them. I explain how the 'gold open access' model (where publishers charge fees to publish in open access) is inadequate for researchers and should be replaced by the 'diamond open access' model, where no fees are required since researchers use the publishing platforms that funding agencies offer them as research infrastructures. I then come up with the following recommendations: - researchers should own the journals they create, for which they produce and peer-review the articles, - researchers need publicly-owned and open source publishing platforms to publish their peer-reviewed articles, - open peer-reviewing should be developed to improve the reproducibility of published results. Researchers should get control of electronic publishing as soon as possible. In the meantime, the 'green open access' model (where one version of a published article is available for free from a repository) remains the best solution to guarantee a smooth transition towards open access for all scholarly publications.},

The intent and use of these features has eluded archaeological consensus, although recent research has reiterated the occurrence of long distance timber importation to Chaco Canyon. To enhance our interpretation of these features we offer a large-scale least cost analysis wherein optimal pathways that are modeled to simulate timber importation are compared to the actual road locations. A series of least cost paths were produced through different energy allocation algorithms, at different spatial scales, and with various origin and destination inputs. Our results reveal a strong correlation between actual road locations and modeled pathways. Therefore, we suggest that certain Chaco roads may have been specifically designed to facilitate the importation of timbers and that roads, once constructed, were the optimal pathway for the import of these resources.},

To produce increasingly effective least cost models, we must more thoroughly consider the role that energetics have played throughout human history and understand how physiological conditions tied to energetics, such as fatigue, influence peoples' decisions when moving. We illustrate this need by modeling a physically demanding case study from the American Southwest and demonstrate that the interpretive consequences of using time- versus energy-based cost function can have meaningful impacts on archaeological reconstructions of the past. Therefore, to better inform the selection of least cost functions in LCA, regardless of the material record in a specific study context, we present a theoretically informed strategy for classifying whether time or energy was a more pertinent cost to past movers by focusing on the role of fatigue and its influence on energetically efficient decision making.},

The purpose of the library was to preserve the knowledge of the past and to maintain scholarship and scribal culture. In the temple library of Nab\^u in Kal·∏´u, there is clear proof that Babylonian scholars played a certain part in the scholarly discourse. Once employed in the palace at Nineveh, Babylonian scholars wrote tablets for the royal library (SAA VIII 499) and taught their special knowledge to Assyrians. The written sources give us a good idea of the composition of the royal library in Nineveh, but the information needs to be correlated with archaeological findings.},

Compared across 2,400 validation pixels, from six images spanning four years, the LDAWI attained an overall accuracy of 98\%, a producer's accuracy for water of 100\%, and a user's accuracy for water of 97\%. These accuracy measures increase to 99\%, 100\% and 98\% if cloud shadow and topographic shadow masks are applied to the imagery. The NDWI achieved consistently lower accuracies, with the NDWI calculated from the green and shortwave infrared (IR) bands performing slightly better (91\% overall accuracy) than the NDWI calculated from the green and near IR bands (89\% overall accuracy). The LDAWI is now being routinely used on an archive of over 2,000 images from across NSW, as part of an operational environmental monitoring program. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Automating the accurate classification of water in Landsat imagery will benefit many researchers conducting large-area multi-temporal analyses of the USGS archive. We propose that water index methods based on data normalised to surface reflectance, using thresholds optimised for a large selection of data, provide a simple yet accurate method for automated water classification across large regions. In order to select the best index for this task a comprehensive comparative analyses was required. We assessed the accuracy of seven water index methods for classifying water in 30m resolution Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imagery from eastern Australia. These indexes were the Automated Water Extraction Index for images with shadows (AWEIshadow) and without shadows (AWEIno shadow), tasselled cap wetness (TCWCrist), two variations of the normalised difference water index (NDWIMcFeeters and NDWIXu), a water index created using canonical variates analysis from top-of-atmosphere data (WI2006), and a new water index created with linear discriminant analysis from data processed to surface reflectance (WI2015). A wide variety of water (50,868), non-water (36,833) and mixed (16,499) validation pixels were selected from Landsat images across the states of New South Wales and Queensland. Water area and the colour of water and non-water features were determined for each validation pixel using coincident high resolution imagery and TM/ETM+ reflectance. A single optimum threshold for classifying each index into water and non-water was determined using pure pixels. In general the WI2015, WI2006 and AWEIshadow performed the best, with all indexes achieving overall accuracies of 95-99\% for pure pixels, and 73-75\% for mixed pixels. Omission errors were more common than commission errors, and water area was usually underestimated, especially where water was green-brown in colour, and/or where water bodies were small or had long perimeters with many mixed pixels. The accuracy of each index was highly dependent on the composition of the validation pixels, with no index performing best across all water and non-water pixel types. All indexes and thresholds were found to perform consistently across images from the TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors, facilitating the automated classification of water to similar levels of accuracy for the growing archive of Landsat data.},

It is argued that integration of remote sensing and GIS can only possibly advance if we develop methods to address the conceptual short-comings of the pixel as a spatial entity, and stop pretending that it is a true geographical object. Three major strands of research which address this issue are highlighted, including mixture modelling, geostatistics and fuzzy classification.},

A growing number of scholars draw on anarchist thought to conceptualize human history and offer solutions grounded in direct democracy for a range of modern ills, including racism, sexism, and structural violence. As scholars wake to the realization that universities have become instruments for the advancement of capital, and as contemporary politics continues to embrace ethnonationalism, neoliberalism, and patriarchy, engagements with anarchist thought and practice have emerged in the academy and more broadly. What does this mean for contemporary archaeology? Here, we raise questions relating to three potential threads: the archaeology of anarchists; the use of anarchism to inform archaeological theory and practice; and the use of archaeological knowledge to inform contemporary anarchisms.},

Recently, Kirch has argued that the most elaborate forms of Oceanic socio-political hierarchy, ideological control, and agricultural intensification evolved in the Hawaiian archipelago, resulting in the emergence of archaic states. In Vanuatu, in contrast, elite power was much less institutionalized, and nothing state-like had emerged in the archipelago at the time of European contact. Starting from two very different forms of social organization, the colonial and post-colonial histories of Vanuatu and Hawai`i are markedly different as well. Archaeology has a useful role to play for understanding why this might be, especially since it can provide a perspective that reaches beyond the limited documentary sources available for people living on the peripheries of state power in the modern world. Materials from agents of the state living in non-state space, and inmates in a state institution are compared to explore the interpretive potential of a common thread of behavior, termed `counterpower.'},

Recent developments in anthropology and archaeology are offered as examples of how this might happen.  Medieval history would benefit from the development of an anarchist approach to questions of ungoverned spaces, domination and inequality, and the growth of states and institutions.

The dam was built between 1981 and 1988 north of the village of Eski Mosul, submerging the course of the Tigris River for c. 100 km. The analysis of historical images derived from declassified Corona satellite imagery acquired between December 1967 and August 1968 reveals the pristine pattern of the Tigris River, including the seasonal changes of its riverbed, shifting across the hydrological year from meandering to anastomosing patterns. Geomorphological mapping based on Corona images allowed us to estimate the seasonal modification of fluvial elements such as the floodplain and point, middle and longitudinal bars. The comparison with Landsat data collected since the 1990s showed the first phases of the basin filling and the control on the present-day aspect of the lake inherited from the setting of the Tigris channel belt and, more in general, the litho-structural control over the evolution of the local hydrographic network; we also document the influence of the original Tigris River course on its recent insertion into the lake. Our work allowed reconstruction of the ancient fluvial landscape below the Mosul Dam Lake and the evolution of its riverscape controlled by litho-structural factors and seasonal variations of the river discharge. Finally, this contribution highlights the relevance of declassified intelligence satellite imagery in interpreting natural geomorphic processes and landforms, today altered by human agency.},

Whilst much is known about the military installations that secured the northern and western provinces of the Empire, the defences that secured the eastern and southern provinces are less well understood. In the case of the eastern desert frontier, there are many fine remains to be found and aerial photography conducted in the first half of the twentieth century has contributed much to our understanding (Kennedy and Riley 1990). However, since the Second World War, restrictions on civil aerial photography in this region have meant that systematic campaigns of aerial reconnaissance have not been possible until quite recently (Kennedy 2002). The declassification in 1995 of an archive of over 860 000 images acquired by the first generation of US photoreconnaissance satellites flown between 1960 and 1972 represents an important historical resource (McDonald 1995a). The archaeological potential of this resource was soon recognized, not the least because of its low cost and extensive coverage of `denied territories' in eastern Europe and Asia (e.g. Fowler 1996). As a result, CORONA imagery has been exploited in the prospection for archaeological features in a number of places including Turkey (Kennedy 1998), Syria (Philip et al. 2002) and Armenia (Palmer 2002). To illustrate the ability of the CORONA product to support archaeological studies, the Cover shows KH-4B imagery of the remains of five Roman military sites (listed in table 1) on the Empire's eastern desert frontier.},

Assyrian civilization did not unfold in isolation. Throughout its history, it absorbed influences from other regions, which in turn adopted elements of Assyrian culture. From early on, Hurrian culture exerted a strong influence on Assyria. In the first millennium BCE, Aramaean culture made a strong impact on Assyria. The Assyrians interacted also with other people, among them Hittites, Luwians, Urartians, and Elamites, and adopted elements of their cultures. Assyria made no attempt to actively promote its language, religion, and literature outside its core area. The cultural changes effected by Assyrian rule in conquered regions were, as a rule, incidental rather than symptoms of deliberate cultural domination. In the Neo-Assyrian period, Assyria expanded even further, morphing into an empire that dominated much of Western Asia.},

From the late ninth to the mid-eighth century, Assyria experiences an era of internal fragmentation, with Assyrian kings and high officials, the so-called ``magnates'', competing for power. The accession of Tiglath-pileser III in 745 BCE marks the end of this period and the beginning of Assyria's imperial phase. The main reason for considering the reign of the A\v{s}\v{s}ur-dan II a new beginning is that it terminates a poorly documented period during which Assyria seems to have experienced a major crisis. With A\v{s}\v{s}ur-dan II, who left several royal inscriptions describing military campaigns in the periphery of the Assyrian core area, the authors appear to enter an era that saw a resurgence of Assyrian power.},

  abstract = {This chapter seeks to describe and analyze the relations between Assyria and Babylonia as they unfolded over time. Like all of Upper Mesopotamia, the ``Assyrian triangle'', demarcated in historical times by the cities Ashur, Nineveh, and Arbela, experienced a phase of pronounced regionalization and ruralization during the first centuries of the third millennium BCE, with little evidence for economic, cultural, or political interaction with the south. From ca. 2700 onwards, however, there are indications of a growing urbanization in the region, and southern influences began to play a more significant role. For several decades, Assyria had to focus its military attention on other regions, especially Urartu, and besides skirmishes with Aramaean semi-nomads in the Assyro-Babylonian border area, little Assyrian activity in the south is recorded. All this changed with the accession of Tiglath-pileser III (744-727), when Assyro-Babylonian relations entered an entirely new phase.},

During its imperial phase, Assyria interacted with various states, cities, and tribes in southern Syria, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Persian Gulf region. This chapter provides a short overview of Assyro-Arabian relations during the Neo-Assyrian period. The overview is mostly based on the testimony of Assyrian royal inscriptions, letters, and a few other cuneiform texts. Assyrian encounters with other places in the ``far south'' were more peaceful and limited to trade and diplomacy. In the east, Assyrian contacts reached from Dilmun to Qade in modern Oman; in the western part of the Arabian Peninsula, the oasis town of Tema played an important role in Arabian-Assyrian trade.},

This is in marked contrast to the far more ``cosmopolitan'' Aramaic literature featuring Assyrian kings, for example, the Ahiqar story or Papyrus Amherst 63, which fully endorse the imperial spirit of the age. The areas where scholars have sought to establish an Assyrian influence on the Bible are political ideology and law. Machinist (1983) and more recently Aster and van der Kooij have argued that especially in the book of Isaiah, but also elsewhere in the Bible, there is a pronounced awareness of Assyrian royal ideology, an ideology most elaborately articulated in Assyrian royal inscriptions.},

This article presents the results of a longitudinal bibliometric study of health science researchers controlling for sub-disciplinary affiliation, education, year of enrollment and age. The productivity and impact of the researchers are analyzed during a 16-year period. We find no or little difference in productivity or impact among the group of health sciences researchers from the time of enrollment in the Ph.D. program and 10years beyond, and women outperform men in some cases. There are negligible differences in productivity and impact prior to enrollment. The implications of the findings are discussed.},

Such studies frequently suffer from a lack of chronological information. This paper presents the results of remote landscape survey in the territory of Spin Boldak (``white desert'') in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, and methodological efforts to detangle the chronology of a landscape made inaccessible by conflict. The studied region crosscuts several environmental zones (desert, alluvial plain, river, and hills) and lies within an important corridor of movement toward mountain passes on the Afghanistan\textendash Pakistan border. Morphological comparisons of surveyed sites to better-documented examples and synthesis of data from a variety of sources allow us to draw chronological and taphonomic conclusions about three types of documented sites: fortified enclosures, caravanserai, and mobile pastoral camps. These methods provide time depth to our understanding of the remotely-mapped landscape and allow us to consider Spin Boldak as a place shaped by local and regional historical processes rather than merely as a timeless thoroughfare between more intensively inhabited locales.},

We discuss the opportunity costs associated with impact work, the fuzziness of current impact measurement, the challenge of incremental results, the actionability of research findings, and the risk of saying something wrong in public. We reflect on these concerns in light of our own experience with impact work and conclude by suggesting a ``post-heroic'' perspective on impact, whereby seemingly mundane activities are linked in a meaningful way.},

For most of Assyrian history, politically as well as economically, Eastern Anatolia was beyond Assyria's political horizon. The Assyrians identified their new rival as the kingdom of Urartu, and due to the predominance of Assyrian sources, modern historians and archaeologists are using the term Urartu rather than Biainili.

Here, we expand archaeological applications of political economy by integrating a bottom-up perspective on the construction of social power, drawing mainly from collective action theory and anarchist theory. An array of interacting agents, diverse interests, and decentralized powers exists in non-state societies. Social segments with countervailing interests and strategies confront, limit, and co-opt elite power. These countervailing forces are fundamental to political economies in these societies, and focusing on them illustrates the ways in which social power and cooperation actually work as differing interests and objectives exist in perpetual tension. The significance of these bottom-up forces is illustrated with synthetic summaries of three historically independent, long-term archaeological sequences\textemdash Northwest Coast hunter-gatherer-fisher societies (case 1), Early Neolithic expansions into Europe (case 2), and the Island Southeast Asia and Pacific region (case 3).

  abstract = {We show that high-resolution space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with pixel sizes smaller than 1 m2 can be used to complement archaeological surveys on intertidal flats. After major storm surges in the 14th and 17th centuries (``Grote Mandrenke''), vast areas on the German North Sea coast were lost to the sea. Areas of settlements and historical farmland were buried under sediments for centuries, but when the surface layer is driven away under the action of wind, currents, and waves, they appear again on the Wadden Sea surface. However, frequent flooding and erosion of the intertidal flats make any archaeological monitoring a difficult task, so that remote sensing techniques appear to be an efficient and cost-effective instrument for any archaeological surveillance of that area. Space-borne SAR images clearly show remains of farmhouse foundations and of former systems of ditches, dating back to the times before the ``Grote Mandrenke''. In particular, the very high-resolution acquisition (``staring spotlight'') mode of the TerraSAR/TanDEM-X satellites allows detecting various kinds of remains of historical land use at high precision. Moreover, SARs working at lower microwave frequencies (e.g., that on Radarsat-2) may complement archaeological surveys of historical cultural traces, some of which have been unknown so far.},

This was the CORONA program imagery and it has proved useful for many applications where image data is difficult to obtain or where historic data is needed. CORONA was the first satellite mission to provide stereoscopic coverage from space and it has already been demonstrated that it is possible to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) from it. The purpose of this paper is to show examples of the quality of elevation data that can be obtained from CORONA stereopairs and to consider the importance of image characteristics (optics, films and filters) which changed with almost every mission and are not widely discussed in the literature. The panoramic geometry of the CORONA cameras is not easily processed by most photogrammetric software packages. The translation of the film data to digital format is also a possible source of error. This research explores the issues surrounding image pre-processing and DEM extraction, and it compares and contrasts the results with other sources of elevation information. The paper also describes problems that are very typical when working in developing countries and it provides a methodology for producing acceptable topographic results. 1},

  abstract = {The Fragile Crescent Project (FCP) is analyzing the rise and decline of Bronze Age urban settlements and associated political and economic structures in the ancient Near East between ca. 3500 and 1200 BC. The Near East is a key area for urban development; but for too long the settlement record from Southern Mesopotamia has been taken as the paradigm for the entire region, and has provided the key data for the reconstruction of the processes of urbanism and state development. Evidence from surveys in northern Mesopotamia and the Levant suggest not only that developments there were very different from those of southern Mesopotamia, but there was marked diversity between different sub-regions. Recent overviews highlight the need for a comprehensive review of the settlement record, and the FCP is an attempt to rectify this lacuna.\textbackslash r\textbackslash nIn order to tackle the diversity of Early Bronze Age urbanization the FCP is harnessing data on trends in settlement drived from as large an area as possible, and, in turn, is relating these data to the regional environment. This requires the creation of a large-scale and coherent set of high quality settlement data to tackle specific questions fundamental to the economic and social dimension of the rise of early states and civilizations. The Fragile Crescent Project is enhancing the value of a series of earlier and ongoing regional surveys by analyzing the data within a single geographical and environmental framework, specifically by taking advantage of recent advances in the use of satellite imagery and digital terrain models. Consequently this is a project that has only recently become possible through the convergence of a range of digital technologies. The core methodology of the project is to re-analyze ``sample'' surveys, the data from which is readily available, and to re-calibrate these within a GIS framework. Remote sensing is used to identify, confirm and provide a landscape context for sites previously recorded in the field (i.e. within existing survey areas) and also provides data on areas that were not surveyed. The FCP therefore is able to extend existing surveys to encompass larger geographical areas that appear more meaningful for the analysis of questions of urban development. The paper demonstrates the value of landscale analysis of high spatial resolution optical imagery and digital terrain models derived from modern and declassified satellite data.},

  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 {$\mu$}m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 {$\mu$}m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as ({$\varrho$}(0.86 {$\mu$}m) - {$\varrho$}(1.24 {$\mu$}m))({$\varrho$}(0.86 {$\mu$}m) + {$\varrho$}(1.24 {$\mu$}m)), where {$\varrho$} represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-{$\mu$}m and the 1.24-{$\mu$}m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 {$\mu$}m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 {$\mu$}m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86\textendash 1.24 {$\mu$}m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-{$\mu$}m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 {$\mu$}m, NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

This region is sandwiched between two known tributary provincial centers of the Aztec empire, but its relationship to the empire is uncertain in colonial documentary materials. Our analyses illuminate changes in social relations from the Middle (A. D. 1150\textendash 1350) to Late Postclassic (A. D. 1350\textendash 1520) periods and shed light on the impact of Aztec imperialism. We use a ceramic unmixing procedure to assign collections to the Middle and Late Postclassic periods for assessment of settlement patterns. Next we use cluster analyses to examine vertical wealth and status differentiation. In the Middle Postclassic period, we observe a concentric gradation of wealth and status away from the small center of El Sauce. Late Postclassic changes include the decline of El Sauce and the founding of a new center at Callej\'on del Horno. The concentric model does not apply to the Late Postclassic period, however, and wealth and status became more highly concentrated at Callej\'on del Horno compared to its hinterland. We also investigate sparse collections-those with few Postclassic rims-to evaluate whether these collections represent poor residences or, rather, sherd scatter from possible field manuring. The lower Blanco region was likely integrated into the Aztec empire on the basis of changes in vertical social differentiation from Middle to Late Postclassic times and percentages of Aztec-style ceramics compared to known Aztec provincial centers, especially Cotaxtla.},

This is a call to pay attention to your digital tools, to be explicit about how you are using them, and to understand how they work and impact your own practice. The chapters in this volume demonstrate how this critical, reflexive approach to archaeology in the digital age can be accomplished, touching on topics that include 3D data, predictive and procedural modelling, digital publishing, digital archiving, public and community engagement, ethics, and global sustainability. The scale and scope of this research demonstrates how necessary it is for all archaeological practitioners to approach this digital age with a critical perspective and to be purposeful in our use of digital technologies.},

Then in the Early Bronze Age, when the kingdom of Mari became established, a system for exploiting the valley appeared, based on different types of canals using gravity flow (for diversion, irrigation, drainage, navigation), the complexity of which necessitated a long period of development. The various canals, the water intake points and the choices of location of the settlements demonstrate an accomplished knowledge and understanding of the principal dynamics that governed the development of the valley, as well as the remarkable technical inventiveness and adaptability of the inhabitants. The quite complete network that has been demonstrated in the area of Mari for the 3rd millennium bc seems to figure among the earliest known. As there is no evidence, in the field in lower Mesopotamia, of other such networks, it might be considered as an ``ancestor'' of the many networks that will come into being in all of the Near East from the 1st millennium bc and especially throughout the last two millennia. It is probably the very first project of large-scale town and country planning that our geomorphological and archaeological prospection, conducted for 9 years, allowed to highlight.},

Multispectral and hyperspectral instruments mounted on orbiting and sub-orbital platforms have provided new and important information for the discovery, delineation and analysis of archaeological sites worldwide. Since the early 1970s, several of the ten NASA centers have collaborated with archaeologists to refine and validate the use of active and passive remote sensing for archaeological use. The Stennis Space Center (SSC), located in Mississippi USA has been the NASA leader in archaeological research. Together with colleagues from Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), SSC scientists have provided the archaeological community with useful images and sophisticated processing that have pushed the technological frontiers of archaeological research and applications. Successful projects include identifying prehistoric roads in Chaco canyon, identifying sites from the Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery exploration, and assessing prehistoric settlement patterns in southeast Louisiana. The Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) stimulated commercial companies to collect archaeological data. At present, NASA formally solicits " space archaeology" proposals through its Earth Science Directorate and continues to assist archaeologists and cultural resource managers in doing their work more efficiently and effectively. This paper focuses on passive remote sensing and does not consider the significant contributions made by NASA active sensors. Hyperspectral data offers new opportunities for future archaeological discoveries. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

  abstract = {Narratives of civilization are spun from the juxtaposition of a civilized self with that of a barbarous other. Such an opposition is never more easily constructed than from the distinctiveness of lowland and mountain topographies, environments, and life-ways. Studies of highland-lowland relationships across different periods, places and disciplines also place the two realms in conceptual opposition and only rarely engage in depth with the interaction that must underwrite all negotiations of identity. We can trace the first attested construction of such a dichotomy in the texts and iconography that detail Mesopotamia's interaction with the Zagros highlands in the later third and second millennia BCE. The recent opening of the Kurdish Region of north-east Iraq to international archaeological research now provides us with the opportunity to investigate Bronze Age communities located in transitional and highland landscapes and their relationships with the lowlands. In this paper we take a critical approach to the conceptualization of highland-lowland interaction in the past and in modern scholarship and formulate a bottom-up, archaeological approach for the investigation of highland-lowland encounters. Drawing on our recent work in the Upper Diyala/Sirwan river valley, we present crucial new settlement and material evidence, which challenges traditional interpretations of the region as a homeland of mountain tribes and begin to write a more balanced, local account of socio-cultural development and external interaction between this borderland region and a series of Bronze Age imperial powers.},

One way of approaching domination in the archaeological record is through the synthetic analysis of different modes of imperial-local interaction at overlapping socio-political levels and spheres of culture. In this paper, four material culture categories are considered with the aim of characterizing Hittite imperial relationships in Late Bronze Age Anatolia and northern Syria. They include pottery traditions and their degree of susceptibility for central influence, diachronic settlement developments, the distribution of imperial administrative technology, and an ideological discourse carried out through landscape monuments. From the spatial and chronological signatures of these overlapping networks of interaction, a more nuanced understanding of the process of empire is beginning to emerge. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The tragedy of climate change science is that at the same time as compelling evidence is gathered, fresh warnings issued, and novel methodologies developed, indicators of adverse global change rise year upon year. Meanwhile, global responses to Covid-19 have shown that even emergent scientific knowledge can bolster radical government action. We explore three options for the climate change science community. We find that two options are untenable and one is unpalatable. Given the urgency and criticality of climate change, we argue the time has come for scientists to agree to a moratorium on climate change research as a means to first expose, then renegotiate, the broken science-society contract.},

The focus of the conflict is regime change, but the triggers include a broad set of religious and sociopolitical factors, the erosion of the economic health of the country, a wave of political reform sweeping over the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Levant region, and challenges associated with climate variability and change and the availability and use of freshwater. As described here, water and climatic conditions have played a direct role in the deterioration of Syria's economic conditions. There is a long history of conflicts over water in these regions because of the natural water scarcity, the early development of irrigated agriculture, and complex religious and ethnic diversity. In recent years, there has been an increase in incidences of water-related violence around the world at the subnational level attributable to the role that water plays in development disputes and economic activities. Because conflicts are rarely, if ever, attributable to single causes, conflict analysis and concomitant efforts at reducing the risks of conflict must consider a multitude of complex relationships and contributing factors. This paper assesses the complicated connections between water and conflict in Syria, looks more broadly at future climate-related risks for water systems, and offers some water management strategies for reducing those risks. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

Although NSF success rates for men and women between 2009 and 2013 were roughly equal, the number of senior women archaeology submissions was half that of men. Given the documented increase in the proportion of women in academic archaeology, this representation of women seemed low. Moreover, submissions for NSF doctoral dissertation improvement grants were evenly divided between men and women. Statistics for Wenner-Gren noted the same general disparity in archaeology. This study examines and integrates a variety of data sources, including interviews with post-PhD women, to determine whether or not there is a problem in research grant submissions. Although the results indicate that there is a problem, it is multifaceted. Women are not well represented at research-intensive universities, and some women instead practice what we term ``scaffolding'' to integrate smaller pots of money to accomplish their research.

The heart of anarchism as a political theory articulates a robust criticism of hierarchy, and neatly intersects growing interests in collaborative archaeology and heritage. This represents a crucial intersection as the majority of archaeological projects remains rigidly hierarchical, often resulting in the silencing of local stakeholder communities. Anarchism's attention to identifying and addressing hierarchy represents a living theory for the decolonization of archaeological practice. The author grounds these thoughts through two case studies. The first examines the importance of situating scholarly interests alongside, or even below local community concerns as they relate to the 1923 Rosewood race riot in Levy County, Florida. The second case study examines how this approach alerts researchers to new projects revealing the unique interactions between Afro-Caribbean and British soilders in Nevis, West Indies. The author's ongoing experience with anarchism continues to transform his personal practice of archaeology. This paper concludes by highlighting anarchism's unique ability to address harmful hierarchical posturing, democratize archaeological knowledge, and support our roles as researchers, educators, and advocates.},

  abstract = {Nineteenth-century Palestine mapping projects based on systematic land surveying reached a peak with the Ordnance Survey of Western Palestine between 1871 and 1877, conducted on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund by officers of the British Royal Engineering Corps. Various other nineteenth-century proposals for an organized survey of the country-some of which bore partial results while others were never implemented-are also presented. The surveying of one region, Mesopotamia, during the 1830s and 1840s, forms the basis for the discussion of the reasons for the relative lateness of the topographical survey. The sacredness of the region seems not to have been a sufficiently convincing motive for entrepreneurs to organize and finance such a survey. The main reason for the delay in mapping the country as a whole was that it was not especially important, either strategically or geo-politically, for the European nations engaged in the international struggles in the Middle East until the last quarter of the nineteenth century./Au XIXe si\`acle, les projets de cartographie de la Palestine \`a partir de lev\'es topographiques d'ensemble ont atteint leur apog\'ee avec l'Ordnance Survey de la Palestine occidentale, r\'ealis\'e entre 1871 et 1877 par des officiers du corps royal des ing\'enieurs de l'arm\'ee britannique sur l'ordre du Fonds d'Exploration de la Palestine. Nous pr\'esentons aussi divers autres projets de lev\'es topographiques du pays au XIXe si\`ecle-certains furent en partie ex\'ecut\'es, d'autres ne furent pas m\^eme commenc\'es. Le cas de la M\'esopotamie, cartographi\'ee au cours des ann\'ees 1830 et 1840, est analys\'e pour comprendre les causes du retard relatif de ces lev\'es topographiques. Le caract\`ere sacr\'e de la terre palestinienne ne semble pas avoir suffi pour convaincre les entrepreneurs d'organiser et de financer de tels lev\'es. Cependant, le retard du projet de cartographie d'ensemble du territoire s'explique avant tout par son faible int\'er\^et, tant strat\'egique que g\'eopolitique, avant le dernier quart du XIXe si\`ecle, pour les pays europ\'eens rivalisant au Proche-Orient./Die Kartierungsprojekte des 19. Jahrhunderts in Pal\"astina, die auf einer systematischen Landvermessung basierten, erreichten mit dem Ordnance Survey of Western Palastine zwischen 1871 und 1877, der im Auftrag vom Palestine Exploration Fund durch Offiziere des British Royal Engineering Corps durchgef\"uhrt wurde, einen H\"ohepunkt. Dar\"uber hinaus werden verschiedene andere Vorschl\"age f\"ur organisiert durchgef\"uhrte Vermessungen des Landes, von denen einige Teilergebnisse lieferten, w\"ahrend andere noch nicht einmal begonnen wurden, vorgestellt. Anhand der Vermessung Mesopotamiens in den 1830er und den 1840er Jahren werden die Gr\"unde f\"ur die erst relativ sp\"at stattfindende topographische Vermessung diskutiert. Dass das Gebiet heilig war, scheint f\"ur m\"ogliche Unternehmer kein ausreichend \"uberzeugendes Motiv gewesen zu sein, die Vermessung zu organisieren und zu finanzieren. Die Hauptursache f\"ur die versp\"atete Kartierung des Landes lag in seiner geringen geopolitischen und strategischen Bedeutung f\"ur die Europ\"aer. Das \"anderte sich erst im letzten Viertel des 19. Jahrhunderts, als sich die Europ\"aischen Staaten in internationale Auseinandersetzungen im Mittleren Osten verwickelt sahen./En el siglo XIX, los proyectos para hacer mapas de Palestina a partir de levantamientos topogr\'aficos de conjunto, alcanzaron su apogeo con la Ordnance Survey de Palestina occidental y fueron realizados entre 1871 y 1877 por oficiales del real cuerpo de ingenieros del ej\'ercito brit\'anico por cuenta de los Fondos de Exploraci\'on de Palestina. Se exponen en el articulo otros proyectos de levantamientos topogr\'aficos del pa\'is en el siglo XIX, algunos parcialmente realizados y otros que ni siquiera se iniciaron. El caso de Mesopotamia, cartografiada en los a\~nos de 1830 y 1840, es analizado para comprender las causas del relativo retraso de estos levantamientos. El car\'acter sagrado Palestina no parece haber influido en los organizadores para poner en marcha y financiar los trabajos. El retraso en iniciar un plan de levantamientos del territorio, se explica por el escaso inter\'es estrat\'egico y geopol\'itico que ten\'ian los pa\'ises europeos involucrados en el Pr\'oximo Oriente antes del \'ultimo cuarto del siglo XIX.},

  abstract = {Many applications that target dynamic land surface processes require a temporal observation frequency that is not easily satisfied using data from a single optical sensor. Sentinel-2 and Landsat provide observations of similar nature and offer the opportunity to combine both data sources to increase time-series temporal frequency at high spatial resolution. Multi-sensor image compositing is one way for performing pixel-level data integration and has many advantages for processing frameworks, especially if analyses over larger areas are targeted. Our compositing approach is optimized for narrow temporal-intervals and allows the derivation of time-series of consistent reflectance composites that capture field level phenologies. We processed more than a year's worth of imagery acquired by Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. We used all data acquired over Germany and integrated observations into composites for three defined temporal intervals (10-day, monthly and seasonal). Our processing approach includes generation of proxy values for OLI in the MSI red edge bands and temporal gap filling on the 10-day time-series. We then derive a national scale crop type and land cover map and compare our results to spatially explicit agricultural reference data available for three federal states and to the results of a recent agricultural census for the entire country. The resulting map successfully captures the crop type distribution across Germany at 30 m resolution and achieves 81\% overall accuracy for 12 classes in three states for which reference data was available. The mapping performance for most classes was highest for the 10-day composites and many classes are discriminated with class specific accuracies {$>$}80\%. For several crops, such as cereals, maize and rapeseed our mapped acreages compare very well with the official census data with average differences between mapped and census area of 11\%, 2\% and 3\%, respectively. Other classes (grapevine and forest classes) perform slightly less well, likely, because the available reference data does not fully capture the variability of these classes across Germany. The inclusion of the red edge bands slightly improved overall accuracies in all cases and improved class specific accuracies for most crop classes. Similarly, our gap filling procedure led to improved mapping accuracies when compared to nongap-filled 10-day features. Overall, our results demonstrate the valuable potential of approaches that utilize data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat which allows for detailed assessments of agricultural and other land-uses over large areas.},

After years of fruitless efforts to solve this ``serials crisis'', open access has been proposed as the latest potential solution. However, also the prices for open access publishing are high and are rising well beyond inflation. What has been missing from the public discussion so far is a quantitative approach to determine the actual costs of efficiently publishing a scholarly article using state-of-the-art technologies, such that informed decisions can be made as to appropriate price levels. Here we provide a granular, step-by-step calculation of the costs associated with publishing primary research articles, from submission, through peer-review, to publication, indexing and archiving. We find that these costs range from less than US\$200 per article in modern, large scale publishing platforms using post-publication peer-review, to about US\$1,000 per article in prestigious journals with rejection rates exceeding 90\%. The publication costs for a representative scholarly article today come to lie at around US\$400. We discuss the additional non-publication items that make up the difference between publication costs and final price.},

Using satellite imagery, we studied their super-imposition revealing an extended chronology of kite-construction, including multiple phases of rebuilding in some cases and kites built relatively recently.

This paper proposes a methodology that compares the performance of several machine learning models so as to select the appropriate predicting model for the assessment of the students' achievements. To fit predicting models, three subjects of the Degree in Computer Science at the University of Le\'on are considered to obtain the dataset: computer organization, computer programming, and operating systems extension. The common aspect of these subjects is their assignments, which are based on developing one or several programs with programming languages such as C or Java. To monitor the practical assignments and individual performance, a Git repository is employed allowing students to store source code, documentation, and supporting control versions. According to the presented experience, there is a huge correlation between the level of interaction for each student and the achieved grades.},

Using GIS we analyzed movement costs that can be applied as of early occupation times in the Southern Andes. We compared curves used to analyze pedestrian movements and contrasted actualistic and ethnographic information in the Andes. We adapted the Tobler Offpath Hiking algorithm to GIS and estimated movement costs in the process of exploiting lithic resources that can be considered within local, non-local and extra-regional categories in Andean topographies as a function of isochrons or times of movement. We propose ``local'' to be the range of space which can be accessed in one 8-hour movement day. On this scale we establish a ranking regarding the costs of accessing the sources of raw material. The resulting movement scales can be useful for works in comparable environments and in different stages of occupation of high-altitude spaces.},

Following an overview of collaborative mapping and its current state in today`s increasingly online and digital world, four potential modes are introduced through which collaborative mapping in archaeology can be carried out: psychogeography, local community involvement, an online archaeology map system and spatial narratives.},

This thesis is primarily about investigating public space and public realm in the historic city centre of Damascus in order to understand the potential for its improvement, and secondarily about recommending specific actions towards this. The research takes a qualitative approach focusing on public space as a `product' which is the result of a process. In terms of the product, the nature, morphological and functional aspects of public spaces in Damascus are examined. The governance process is analysed at local level to define main actors, the rules they interact with and the rationalities they use to intervene in public space. This analysis includes locality-specific literature review and interviews with key informants. Such case study analysis is undertaken against the background of a survey of public space regeneration in selected cities around the Mediterranean.},

The objective of atmospheric correction is to determine true surface reflectance values by removing atmospheric effects from satellite images. Atmospheric correction is arguably the most important part of the pre-processing of satellite remotely sensed data and any omission produces erroneous results. The effects of the atmosphere are more severe for where dark targets are shown in the satellite image. In the management of cultural heritage sites, since temporal satellite images are required for monitoring purposes, the effect of the atmosphere must be considered. Classification techniques are also required to map land-cover changes in the vicinity of important cultural-heritage sites. Detection of important cultural heritage sites needs effective post-processing techniques. Indeed, any unsuccessful attempt to remove the atmospheric effects from the satellite remotely sensed images may cause non-reliable reflectance values. The paper presents a method of assessing the need for atmospheric correction, and addresses the importance of removing atmospheric effects in the satellite remote sensing of land-surfaces including cultural heritage.},

As these digital technologies are being used more and more every day on excavations or in museums, this also means that we must change the way we approach teaching and communicating archaeology as a discipline. The communication of archaeology is an often neglected but ever more important part of the profession. Instead of traditional lectures and museum displays, we can interact with the past in various ways. Students of archaeology today need to learn and understand these technologies, but can on the other hand also profit from them in creative ways of teaching and learning. The same holds true for visitors to a museum. This volume presents the outcome of a two-day international symposium on digital methods in teaching and learning in archaeology held at the University of Cologne in October 2018 addressing exactly this topic. Specialists from around the world share their views on the newest developments in the field of archaeology and the way we teach these with the help of archaeogaming, augmented and virtual reality, 3D reconstruction and many more. Thirteen chapters cover different approaches to teaching and learning archaeology in universities and museums and offer insights into modern-day ways to communicate the past in a digital age.},

Like other sources of historical imagery, U2 photos provide a window into the past, before modern agriculture and development destroyed many archaeological sites. U2 imagery is older and in many cases higher resolution than CORONA spy satellite imagery, the other major source of historical imagery for Eurasia, and thus can expand the range of archaeological sites and features that can be studied from an aerial perspective. However, there are significant barriers to finding and retrieving U2 imagery of particular locales, and archaeologists have thus not yet widely used it. In this article, we aim to reduce these barriers by describing the U2 photo dataset and how to access it. We also provide the first spatial index of U2 photos for the Middle East. A brief discussion of archaeological case studies drawn from U2 imagery illustrates its merits and limitations. These case studies include investigations of prehistoric mass-kill hunting traps in eastern Jordan, irrigation systems of the first millennium BC Neo-Assyrian empire in northern Iraq, and twentieth-century marsh communities in southern Iraq.},

Over the last decade, researchers investigating contemporary urban systems have suggested a novel explanation for the links between the numbers of inhabitants in settlements and many of their most important characteristics, which is grounded in a view of settlements as social networks embedded in built environments. One of the remarkable aspects of this approach is that it is not based on the specific conditions of the modern world (such as capitalism or industrialization), which raises the issue of whether the relationships observed in contemporary urban systems can also be detected in pre-modern urban or even non-urban systems. Here, we present a general model for the relationship between the population and functional diversity of settlements, where the latter is viewed as an indicator of the division of labour. We then explore the applicability of this model to pre-modern contexts, focusing on cities in the Roman Empire, using estimates of their numbers of inhabitants, numbers of documented professional associations, and numbers of recorded inscriptions to develop an index of functional diversity. Our results are consistent with theoretical expectations, adding further support to the view that urban systems in both contemporary and pre-modern contexts reflect a common set of generative processes.},

These included Rome, which is usually agreed to have had a population of about 1 million; Alexandria, which might have had c. 500,000; Antioch, which could have had at least 150,000; and Carthage and Ephesus (Scheidel does not give explicit figures for those).},

  abstract = {Performative engagements with specific, culturally significant places were among the primary means of configuring landscapes in the ancient world. Ancient states often appropriated symbolic or ritual landscapes through commemorative ceremonies and building operations. These commemorative sites became event-places where state spectacles encountered and merged with local cult practices. The Early Iron Age inscriptions and reliefs carved on the cave walls of the Dibni Su sources at the site of Birkleyn in Eastern Turkey, known as the `Source of the Tigris' monuments, present a compelling paradigm for such spatial practices. Assyrian kings Tiglath-pileser I (1114\textendash 1076 B.C.) and Shalmaneser III (858\textendash 824 B.C.) carved `images of kingship' and accompanying royal inscriptions at this impressive site in a remote but politically contested region. This important commemorative event was represented in detail on Shalmaneser III's bronze repouss\'e bands from Imgul-Enlil (Tell Balawat) as well as in his annalistic texts, rearticulating the performance of the place on public monuments in Assyrian urban contexts. This paper approaches the making of the Source of the Tigris monuments as a complex performative place-event. The effect was to reconfigure a socially significant, mytho-poetic landscape into a landscape of commemoration and cult practice, illustrating Assyrian rhetorics of kingship. These rhetorics were maintained by articulate gestures of inscription that appropriated an already symbolically charged landscape in a liminal territory and made it durable through site-specific spatial practices and narrative representations.},

Water supply is also under pressure from upstream water management, drought, and structural decline. In this research, we used a satellite-based algorithm, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), to monitor changes in the extent of surface reservoirs (1985-present). We compared the timeline of reservoir fluctuations with the timeline of events related to conflicts, droughts, and dam management. Our results show that the most sudden changes in water supply occurred during events related to conflict, but conflict was not often a cause of the greatest absolute changes to reservoir area. Though not as precise as on-the-ground information, satellite data can give insights to water supply when conflict has disrupted the flow of information or restricted on-the-ground data collection.},

What was the status of the Kingdom after its annexation by Assyria in 732 BCE? Who conquered Samaria, the capital of the Kingdom? When did it happen? One of the primary reasons for this situation lies in the discrepancies found in the historical sources, namely the Hebrew Bible and the Assyrian texts. Since biblical studies and Assyriology are two distinct disciplines, the gaps in the sources are not easy to bridge. Moreover, recent great progress in the archaeological research in the Southern Levant provides now crucial new data, independent of these textual sources. This volume, a collection of papers by leading scholars from different fields of research, aims to bring together, for the first time, all the available data and to discuss these conundrums from various perspectives in order to reach a better and deeper understanding of this crucial period, which possibly triggered in the following decades the birth of "new Israel" in the Southern Kingdom of Judah, and eventually led to the formation of the Hebrew Bible and its underlying theology"-- The last days of the Northern Kingdom of Israel : introducing the proceedings of a multi-disciplinary conference / Shuichi Hasegawa -- Part I: Setting the scene.

In Achaemenid royal inscriptions from the royal tombs at Naqsh-i Rustam, Bisotun, and Susa, ``Athuria'' is consistently mentioned as one of the provinces of the empire next to, but distinct from Babylonia. Only few remnants of either Neo-Babylonian or Achaemenid date are known from Nineveh. Still elusive archaeological evidence for the post-imperial period is found at Ashur. The most important ``post-imperial'' building is the so-called ``Temple A'', which served as a repository for earlier Assyrian building inscriptions. This temple within the Assur temple precinct shows the Babylonian design of consecutive transverse rooms for anteroom and cella.},

This new interest in scholarly knowledge might, in part, be connected to the new style of Assyrian kingship: the kings believed increasingly in strengthening their power through knowledge. While the Assyrian scholars relied heavily upon the Babylonian tradition, they also authored specific Assyrian texts and text genres. First and foremost among these were long and complex royal inscriptions relating the military activities of a king. Tracing the families of Middle Assyrian scholars back more than one or two generations is difficult, however. This is illustrated by the case of the diviner Samas-zera-iddina, who wrote at least four manuals about extispicy during the time of Tiglath-pileser I, all of which were found in Ashur and which name Samas-zera-iddina's father, Samas-suma-lesir.},

We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process.},

The number of LCP studies in archaeology has increased rapidly during the last couple of years, but not all of the approaches applied are based on an appropriate model and implementation. Many archaeologists rely on standard GIS software with default settings for calculating LCPs and are not aware of possible alternatives and the pitfalls that are described in this article.  After briefly introducing the aims and applications of LCP methods in archaeology, LCP algorithms are discussed. The outcome of the LCP calculations depends not only on the algorithm but also on the cost model, which often includes several cost components. The discussion of the cost components has a focus on slope, because nearly all archaeological LCP studies take this cost component into account and because several methodological issues are connected with slope-based cost models. Other possible cost components are: the load of the walker, vegetation cover, wetlands or other soil properties, travelling and transport on water, water as barrier and as attractor, aspect, altitude, and social or cultural cost components. Eventually, advantages and disadvantages of different ways of combining cost components are presented. Based on the methodological issues I conclude that both validation checks and variations of the model are necessary to analyse the reliability of archaeological LCP results.},

  abstract = {Fluctuations in climate have been associated with significant societal changes, both in the modern day and in the past. In dryland environments such as much of Southwest Asia, rainfall is often used as a proxy for soil moisture available for crop production, and in pre-industrial societies this is assumed to directly relate to food production capacity and security. However, rainfall values are commonly quoted in archaeological literature without further context. Variability between values arising from different methods and timescales are rarely considered. This is important as small changes in rainfall can have profound effects on the interpretation of sites and landscapes. Here, we present a novel set of snapshot precipitation maps for Southwest Asia between the years 10,240 BP and 300 BP, based on previously published natural archive data by Bar-Matthews and Ayalon (2004) from Soreq Cave, and a newly derived modern rainfall map. The modern map was created using station data from the years 1960\textendash 1990 and a geostatistical interpolation technique applied across 14 separate zones. We outline the steps involved in the creation of the maps and provide access to, and clear explanations of, the data and methods used. Using the hindcasted maps, two case studies to highlight why a nuanced approach to rainfall is required in the study of ancient societies are examined. Changes to the spatial extent of the so-called `Zone of Uncertainty' through time, as well as land suitable for rainfed agriculture throughout time using a simple model are calculated. It is demonstrated that relatively small fluctuations in rainfall can have a significant impact on the distribution of moisture availability for the region. It is argued that archaeologists need to be aware of the sources and limitations of the rainfall data used in their interpretations, and our map series is offered as a baseline dataset.},

In a recent American Antiquity forum, van der Leeuw and Redman (2002) argue that current environmental research would benefit from an archaeological perspective on these problems, and that our discipline would benefit from more active engagement in the larger debate. I present research supporting the claim that archaeology has unique and compelling insights to offer socio-natural studies. I make arguments based on spatial statistical and GIS analyses of past land use in the Wadi al-Hasa, west-central Jordan, that environmental degradation in the form of soil erosion has been a problem for agropastoralists in that region for several millennia. Furthermore, I argue that an archaeological perspective on long-term patterns of land use provides information at a scale and resolution that makes it highly suitable for studies of human-environment dynamics. Archaeology's unique data and perspective create an opportunity to contribute in a more explicit manner to the study of contemporary environmental issues that currently lack long-term focus at a scale and resolution that is meaningful to humans.},

Archaeologists usually have to estimate population from settlement area, and a general relationship between the logarithm of settlement area and the logarithm of population size has been observed to exist. Some researchers have considered the types of processes involved in the growth of hierarchies and have discussed the rank-size relationships that result. In many cases, it may be difficult to estimate precisely the size of prehistoric sites or only parts of the sites may have been inhabited at any one time. Any original rank-size relationship is blurred and distorted by the time it reaches the archaeologist. The chapter discusses the various types of stochastic processes, which can best be seen as generating a wide range of archaeological data. The chapter also focuses on the nature and interpretations of deviations from expected patterns. The most marked differences from the end results of relatively unconstrained stochastic processes occur with the more reliable data sets in which there has been some constraint on the development of a hierarchy. The closest similarities with simple stochastic processes occur with apparently reliable data in a purely rural situation where the probable lack of any constraints, at least in the formation and perhaps in the survival of the pattern, may be assumed. The structure in each rank-size curve is the composite result of a complex balance between original forces and survival and recovery processes.},

  abstract = {Mapping ancient roads is crucial to tell credible geospatial stories about where, how, or why different people might have travelled or transported materials within and between places in the distant past. Achieving this process is challenging and commonly accomplished by means of archaeological and GIS methods and materials. It is not uncommon for different experts employing these methods to generate inconsistent delineations of the same ancient roads, creating confusion about how to produce knowledge and decisions based on multiple geospatial perspectives. This yet to be adequately addressed problem motivates our desire to enrich existing literature on the nature and extents of these differences. We juxtapose GIS and archaeologically generated road maps for northern Etruria, a region of ancient Italy with a well-developed road network built by the Etruscans and Romans. We reveal map differences through a map comparison approach that integrates a broad set of qualitative and quantitative measures plus geospatial concepts and strategies. The differences are evident in route locations, sinuosities, lengths, and complexities of the terrains on which the routes were set as defined by subtle variations in elevation, slope, and ruggedness. They ranged from 11.2\textendash 34.4 km in road length, 0\textendash 65.7 m in road relief, 1.0\textendash 13.5\% in mean road grade, 0.07\textendash 0.79 in detour indices and 0.19\textendash 3.08 for mean terrain roughness indices, all of which can be considerable depending on application. Taken together, the measures proved effective in furthering our understanding of the range of possible disagreements between ancient linear features mapped by different experts and methods and are extensible for other application areas. They point to the importance of explicitly acknowledging and maintaining all usable perspectives in geospatial databases as well as visualization and analysis processes, regardless of levels of disagreement, and especially where ground-truth informed assessments cannot be reliably performed.},

  abstract = {In archaeology, time is used to convey a wide range of meanings with common usage in just a couple of senses. Thus, we students of time must devote considerable time to establishing the timing of past events, the lapse of time, and learning about times past.  The point of departure for this volume lies in the post-tumultuous times of processual archaeology, in the 1970s and 1980s, when Geoff Bailey, Lewis Binford, David Clarke, Robert Dunnell, Robert Foley, and Michael Schiffer, among others, initiated a deconstruction of time as used in archaeology. Here, the authors further this deconstruction.  Time in Archaeology was originally convened as an electronic symposium held at the Society of American Archaeology meetings in 2003. The result is a tightly focused group of papers that provide both a historical background to the development of the ideas of time perspectivism as well as a range of case studies that illustrate where scholars have taken the ideas. This book demonstrates the importance of concepts of time with excellent discussions and perspectives from twelve scholars working in vastly different arenas. It is a rigorous examination of the assumptions we make and the impacts of those assumptions. After reading this you may never think about time in quite the same way.},

During the subsequent Climatic Optimum, agricultural villages spread rapidly but subsequent climatic changes on centennial to millennial scales resulted in striking oscillations in settlement, especially in marginal areas. Natural climate change thus alternately enhanced and diminished the agricultural potential of the land. Growing populations and more intensive land us, both for agriculture and livestock, have led to changes in the structure of vegetation, hydrology, and land quality. Over the millennia, political and economic interventions, warfare and incursions by nomadic herding tribes all impacted sustainability of agriculture and the ability of the land to supports its populations. In much of the region today, agricultural land use is not sustainable given existing technology and national priorities. The Near Eastern case is instructive because of the quality of information, the length of the record, and the pace of modern change.},

  abstract = {The early pioneers of archaeological Geographic Information Systems (GIS) advocated for a future where this technology was more than a data-management tool. To this end, they emphasized harnessing the analytic power of GIS to advance innovative understandings of past social landscapes. This paper introduces the special issue, explaining its aims to offer a current assessment of how this vision has been realized. Three themes related to both persistent questions and emergent horizons in archaeological GIS are explored in the context of the contributions. We present our own set of ideas for how to unbind our analyses from some of the methodological and conceptual constraints inherent in the analytic GIS approaches on which we have long relied to explore past landscapes. We argue it is important to keep moving beyond analytic approaches tethered to discrete points, to push forward geospatial modeling of cultural processes across entire landscapes, and to incorporate uncertainty and iteration directly into our work. Through such efforts, we can develop robust insights into the ways past communities considered, reconfigured, and renewed patterns of social, economic, and ideological interaction, flow, and circulation through the variegated landscapes they inhabited. In doing this, we will get closer to realizing the ambitious vision early pioneers had for archaeological GIS \textendash{} a technology they believed could let us ask entirely new questions about the past.},

This article reports the results of recent geo-archaeological investigation of three complementary resources in southern Mesopotamia that are thought to have offered an ecological advantage, thus laying the economic foundations for these developments: (1) expansive irrigable plains; (2) vast pasture lands; and (3) the littoral resources of levee back swamps/deltaic marshes. Focusing on the area of the Hawr al-Hammar marshes, the authors conducted preliminary archaeological, geological and landscape investigation over the course of 18 days in the autumn of 2010, funded by a U.S. National Science Foundation High Risk Research in Physical Anthropology and Archaeology grant.},

Using southern Mesopotamia as a case study, this article addresses, both quantitatively and qualitatively, long-held assumptions concerning the nature and relationship of settlement patterns and river channel systems in antiquity. GIS and image analysis are used to fill in gaps in the settlement record and propose a revised location for the Tigris River during most of antiquity. Given that only one-third of the central alluvial plain had been ground surveyed in southern Mesopotamia, how complete was our picture of landscape and settlement? How could gaps in settlement be interpreted? The present work in the area east of Baghdad suggests that archaeologists and historians have underestimated the nature and movements of the Tigris River. Satellite imagery can help reveal the location of the Tigris River prior to its settling into its modern course, shedding light on its potential role in the rise of early Mesopotamian agricultural societies. The work presented here proposes a methodology for unweaving and mapping preserved pieces of ancient landscapes, addressing larger issues of human modification of the landscape. \textcopyright{} Trustees of Boston University 2010.},

From the first aerial reconnaissance programs, archaeologists recognized the value of a view from above to address overarching human-environmental questions that underpin regional historical narratives. The diversity and density of visible remains in the landscape of the Middle East has required an integrative approach, encompassed in the perspective of landscape as a static artifact, landscape as built features, landscape as a system, and landscape as a dynamic construct, which cuts across modern political boundaries. Recent advances in geospatial tools and datasets have enabled archaeologists to make significant progress on four long-standing questions of how to (1) best document and manage rapidly disappearing ancient landscapes, (2) understand landscape formation processes, (3) identify and interpret economic, environmental, and social influences that result in long-term settlement and land use patterns, and (4) recognize and contextualize the interplay between environment and human agency in the evolution of ancient economies and transformations in socio-organizational complexity. \textcopyright{} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

M(C,N) was found in nitrogendoped specimens. The increased nitrogen content results in a change in carbide morphology from acicular or Chinese-script type to a blocky one. Carbide size increases from 6.85 to 7.25 {$\mu$}m at 2.5 {$\mu$}m/s and from 2.31 to 2.81 {$\mu$}m at 200 {$\mu$}m/s as the nitrogen content increases from 5 to 22 ppm; carbide size is reduced to 5.2 {$\mu$}m at 2.5 {$\mu$}/s and to 2.1 {$\mu$}m at 200 {$\mu$}m/s when nitrogen content is further raised to 30 ppm. There is no evident change in carbide content (area percentage) with increase of nitrogen. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis revealed characteristic centers in some of the blocky carbides of TiN, as nuclei of MC or M(C,N) formed in the melt. The influences of nitrogen on carbide at the low solidification rate are stronger than those at the higher rate. With the increase of solidification rate, the carbide turns from bar to Chinese-script type, except for the base alloy at 2.5 {$\mu$}m/s, and the content and size decrease.},

This includes so-called `middle road' and `post-colonial' approaches, which reinforce the status quo by limiting political action. In our search for an alternative, we discuss here our attempts to teach an anti-colonial archaeology rooted in critical pedagogy, political activism and anti-oppressive practice. At its core are three tenets: archaeology is personal, political and all about the present. While we are gratified by the many students who relish this opportunity for critical enquiry, we are faced with this lingering problem: most people do not want to hear the ``negative reality'' of archaeology.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;The Barada River that originates in the Zabadani valley, within the western Anti-Lebanon Mountains (Syria), is the major watercourse within the Damascus Basin at the south-eastern sector of the Palmyrides chain. Since the early-mid Holocene, several human settlements have appeared in the area thanks to the water resource guaranteed by the Barada River, some ephemeral streams developing over a series of alluvial fan bodies fringing the piedmont zone at the margin of the Damascus Basin, and the \&amp;\#160;Al-Ataibeh Lake, in the eastern part of the basin, nowadays rarely reached by the Barada River outside the spring and the flood periods.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The importance of fluvial processes in the development of the active and relict landforms within the Damascus basin, as well as for the development and distribution of historical human settlements, is noticeably pointed out by the occurrence of several alluvial fans and associated deposits in the piedmont area. Their characterization of the piedmont processes and landforms in this specific zone can benefit from a remote approach based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) because of the large extension of the area preventing the exclusive field-based mapping and, moreover, in this zone as in the whole Syrian territory, the foreign research has been significantly restricted with the only exception for the archaeological ones. In this work, the interferometric 1-arcsec SRTM and the optical SPOT DEM with 8 m of ground resolution have been adopted for measuring morphometric variables useful to discriminate the prevailing fan feeding processes, considering that the construction and the development of fan deposits can be the results of fluvial processes (fluvial dominated fan), mass movements (debris-flow dominated fan) or by their combination in either space or time (composite fan). Unravelling the principal constructional process can be helpful for deciphering the main factor, amongst climate, tectonics, and human activities, influencing fans formation and their space-time development\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The main aim of this study is the mapping and classification of the main alluvial fans along the south-eastern margin of the Anti-Lebanon mountains, distinguishing which kind of constructional process prevails in the area starting from a land-surface quantitative analysis. Eight alluvial fans have been selected, among which the most extensive is the westernmost one, developed by the Barada River. A series of morphometric variables have been computed using GIS useful for describing the surficial expression of the fan deposits, the upstream catchment morphology, and their relationship This work presents the preliminary results of the study and, for the first time, a preliminary geomorphological scheme of the piedmont zone along the northern margin of the Damascus Basins. Here, the occurrence of several archaeological settlements seems to be strongly influenced by the geomorphological framework of the area, suggesting a key role of the fans development in the spatial distribution of the early human settlements.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

The region is currently facing water shortage problems due to the increase of the demand and climate changes. In the present study, average monthly water flow measurements for 15 stream flow gaging stations within basins of these rivers in Iraq with population growth rate data in some of its part were used to evaluate the reality of the current situation and future challenges of water availability and demand in Iraq. The results showed that Iraq receives annually 70.29 km3 of water 45.4 and 25.52 km3 from River Tigris and Euphrates respectively. An amount of 18.04 km3 is supplied by its tributaries inside Iraq. The whole amount of water in the Euphrates Rivers comes outside the Iraqi borders. Annual decrease of the water inflow is 0.1335 km3 yr-1 for Tigris and 0.245 km3 yr-1 for Euphrates. This implies the annual percentage reduction of inflow rates for the two rivers is 0.294 and 0.960\% respectively. Iraq consumes annually 88.89\% (63.05 km3) of incoming water from the two rivers, where about 60.43 and 39.57\% are from Rivers Tigris and Euphrates respectively. Water demand increases annually by 0.896 km3; of which 0.5271 and 0.475 km3 within Tigris and Euphrates basins respectively. The average water demand in 2020 will increase to 42.844 km3 yr-1 for Tigris basin and for Euphrates 29.225 km3 yr-1 (total 72.069 km3 yr-1), while water availability will decrease to 63.46 km3 yr-1. This means that the overall water shortage will be restricted to 8.61 km3.},

These canals, built up over generations, have long formed the basis of settlement patterns and state relations in the region, making their location and mapping of key interest to archaeologists. However, since 1991, western archaeologists have not been allowed into Iraq, and consequently have been unable to conduct ground surveys. This work focuses on automating the detection of these critical irrigation canals. Owing to a process of silt deposition, the canals gradually raise their banks above the surrounding plain. Using free elevation data collected by NASA in 2000, we use a combination of image filters and tracing algorithms to detect and highlight the ancient canals, quickly scanning an area for archaeologically relevant details. Our method was generally successful in detecting very large and old canals, but data noise and resolution prevented the detection of smaller features.},

These journals exploit the noble idea of the Open Access movement, whose goal is to make the latest scientific findings available for free. Predatory journals, unlike the reputable ones working on an Open Access basis, neglect the review process and publish low-quality submissions. The basic attributes of predatory journals are a very quick review process or even none at all, failure to be transparent about author fees for publishing an article, misleading potential authors by imitating the names of well-established journals, and false information on indexing in renowned databases or assigned impact factor. Some preventive measures against publishing in predatory journals or drawing information from them are: a thorough credibility check of the journals webpages, verification of the journals indexing on Bealls List and in the following databases: Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, ERIH PLUS and DOAJ. Asking other scientists or scholars about their experience with a given journal can also be helpful. Without these necessary steps authors face an increased risk of publishing in a journal of poor quality, which will prevent them from obtaining Research and Development Council points (awarded based on the Information Register of Research \& Development results); even more importantly, it may damage their reputation as well as the good name of their home institution in the professional community.Key words: academic writing - medical journals - Open Access - predatory journals - predatory publishers - scientific publications.},

Due to this problem, power plant located in Koa catchment, Kahalgaon, Bihar, is faces huge loss at the time of flood. In this paper, the flood-affected areas in Koa catchment have been mapped using remote sensing satellite data (IRS LISS III, 1999 and Landsat TM, 1995). A range of image processing techniques has been used, including simple density slicing, Tasseled Cap Transformation and water-specific index. The results obtained using different approaches have been analysed.

The era of Assur-uballit, who was the first ruler of Ashur to use the royal title sarru ``king'' since the days of Samsi-Addu, was regarded as the true moment of the birth of ``Assyria'' by later generations. Assur-uballit claimed admission as a Great King into the ``Club of Brothers'', i. e. the great powers of his time. These rulers were wedded to the idea of territorial expansion: a Great King had to move the borders of his realm into the barbaric world outside of his kingdom, so that it would comprise the whole world. Political realism, on the other hand, led to the conclusion that such an aim could not be realized. After Assyria's loss of dominion over its southern neighbor, trust in the authority of Tukulti-Ninurta might have declined in his own land.},

The designation of income and expenditure within the royal administration as ``belonging to the palace'' (\v{s}a ekalle) has to be understood in this sense. Based on the model of the capital's palace there were royal residences in other Assyrian cities or rural estates all over the realm. A symbol of royal power, the palace was the center of the land's government. The administration of the ``land of Ashur'' was headed by the king, who acted as the intermediary between gods and men. All of the offices were, at least in theory, responsible toward the king. The majority of written sources from the Middle Assyrian period pertain to the area of public administration. Even archives from private houses contain many documents dealing with administrative matters.},

However, two major problems have been often encountered: (a) NDWIs calculated from different band combinations [visible, nearinfrared, or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)] can generate different results, and (b) NDWI thresholds vary depending on the proportions of subpixel water/non-water components. We need to evaluate all the NDWIS for determining the best performing index and to establish appropriate thresholds for clearly identifying water features. We used the spectral data obtained from a spectral library to simulate the satellite sensors Landsat ETM+, SPOT-5, ASTER, and MODIS, and calculated the simulated NDWI in different forms. We found that the NDWI calculated from (green - swm)/(green + SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength region (1.2 to 1.8 {$\mu$}m), has the most stable threshold. We recommend this NDWI be employed for mapping water, but adjustment of the threshold based on actual situations is necessary. \textcopyright{} 2009 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

  abstract = {Over 30 years ago, Kintigh and Ammerman (1982) outlined and applied a heuristic approach to spatial archaeology that balanced quantitative analyses and culturally and historically contextualized archaeology. The theoretical and methodological messages were that we need to do more than ``eyeball'' spatial patterns, we need to apply the proper analyses based on the characteristics of our datasets, and we need to ensure that our models, quantitative analyses, and resulting interpretations are based in the proper cultural and historical contexts. My goal in this paper is to examine how two of the concepts in this approach, significance and context, apply to a modern spatial archaeology that heavily utilizes geospatial computing tools. Although these tools help to solve several concerns that existed in the field 30 years ago, they can also cause others, such as mistaking autocorrelation for correlation or confusion about which of the multitude of available analytical tools is appropriate for particular questions and datasets. In this paper, I present a simplified version of the methodology I have used to address these concerns. I use archaeological, historical, and GIS-modeled data to compare the regional patterning of hierarchical and egalitarian societies in southeastern North America to examine why hierarchical sociopolitical organizations may have arose where they did. I end with a critical review of this approach and a discussion of how such research can be improved moving forward.},

Fieldwork in- cluded ``ground truthing'' of the remote sensing work, manually drilling bore- holes (up to 7min depth), sedimentary and geomorphological documentation and sample collection for radiocarbon dating. As a result, five main courses of the Euphrates in five different periods have been mapped in this area, includ- ing four previously unidentified and/or unlocated migrations that linked the different periods. The main courses are the Purattum Course (before 3100\textendash{} 1000 BC), the Arahtum Course (1000\textendash 125 BC), the Sura Course (125 BC to AD 1258), the Hilla Course (13th to 19th century AD), and the Hindiya Course (19th to 20th century AD). There has been an overall migration of the main channel from east to west across the study area over time. The location of avul- sion nodes changed along the length of the river, mainly downstream over time, but with a cluster of avulsion events near Babylon and a notable man- made interference in the 20th century at the Hindiya Barrage.},

  abstract = {For decades, it has been unclear as to how the world's first cities, in southern Mesopotamia, not only arose in a fluvial environment but also how this environment changed. This paper seeks to understand the long-term fluvial history of the region around Uruk, a major early city, in relation to water-human interactions. This paper applies geomorphological, historical and archaeological approaches and reveals that the Uruk region in southern Mesopotamia had been under the influence of freshwater fluvial environment since the early Holocene. It further demonstrates how canals and long-term human activities since the mid Holocene have been superimposed on the natural river channel patterns. Fieldwork has been conducted to ground-truth features identified applying remote sensing techniques. Five sediment cores were analysed to elucidate palaeoenvironmental changes. Radiocarbon ages for organic samples suggest that the oldest sediment layers, at a depth of 12.5 m, are from the Early Holocene, while results from diatom analyses imply that the whole sediment column was deposited in a freshwater environment. Intensive networks of palaeochannels and archaeological sites within the study area have been reconstructed and these networks have been divided into four different time intervals based on changes in channel courses. The first is from the early 4th to the late 1st millennium BCE; the second is from the late 1st millennium BCE to the middle 2nd millennium CE; the third lasted from after the Islamic period until the 1980s; the fourth is from the 1980s until the present. Key results include evidence for freshwater environments and favourable settlement conditions had already formed by the 8th millennium BCE. The favourable settlement environment resulted in stable (long-lived) canals between the 4th millennium BCE and 1st millennium CE. A significant settlement and irrigation expansion occurred in the early 1st millennium CE. Major abandonment ensued in the late 1st millennium CE and lasted until the mid 2nd millennium CE.},

In this study, remotely sensed hollow ways were ground-truthed and dated by association with both palaeochannels and known archaeological sites. Contextual and morphological evidence of the hollow ways indicate that they are likely the archaeological manifestation of ethnographically attested ``water channels'' formed through the dense reeds of marshlands in southern Iraq, not formed by traction overland like other known hollow ways. The map itself documents the first known hollow ways preserved underwater and one of the best-preserved landscapes of past human movement in the Near East.},

Such an understanding would lead in turn to a greatly enhanced understanding of the landscape, social structure, political life and economy of that area. For the Mesopotamian floodplain, intensive water-management activities, together with the frequent avulsions of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, have rendered channel networks complex and interlocked. This complexity has long confused researchers in regard to channel origins, and whether they are natural or anthropogenic, or a combination of the two. It is a challenging task, but the present work proposes and discusses seven key differences between the two types of channels, namely topographical cross-sections, crevasse splays, marshes, meandering, cut-offs and oxbow lakes, channel patterns, and stream directions. The discussion is based on geomorpho- logical, remote-sensing, historical and archaeological data.

  abstract = {Quantification of the water cycle components is key to managing water resources. Remote sensing techniques and products have recently been developed for the estimation of water balance variables. The objective of this study was to test the reliability of LandSAF (Land Surface Analyses Satellite Applications Facility) evapotranspiration (ET) and SPOT-Vegetation Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) by comparison with ground-based measurements. Evapotranspiration (both daily and 30 min) was successfully estimated with LandSAF products in a flat area dominated by fynbos vegetation (Riverlands, Western Cape) that was representative of the satellite image pixel at 3 km resolution. Correlation coefficients were 0.85 and 0.91 and linear regressions produced R2 of 0.72 and 0.75 for 30 min and daily ET, respectively. Ground-measurements of soil water content taken with capacitance sensors at 3 depths were related to NDWI obtained from 10-daily maximum value composites of SPOT-Vegetation images at a resolution of 1 km. Multiple regression models showed that NDWI relates well to soil water content after accounting for precipitation (adjusted R2 were 0.71, 0.59 and 0.54 for 10, 40 and 80 cm soil depth, respectively). Changes in NDWI trends in different land covers were detected in 14-year time series using the breaks for additive seasonal and trend (BFAST) methodology. Appropriate usage, awareness of limitations and correct interpretation of remote sensing data can facilitate water management and planning operations.},

And as archaeologists accustomed to dealing with ``deep time,'' how can we best understand the possibilities and limitations of the Web in meeting the specialized needs of professionals in this field? These are among the many questions posed and addressed in Archaeology 2.0: New Approaches to Communication and Collaboration, edited by Eric Kansa, Sarah Whitcher Kansa, and Ethan Watrall. With contributions from a range of experts in archaeology and technology, this volume is organized around four key topics that illuminate how the revolution in communications technology reverberates across the discipline: approaches to information retrieval and information access; practical and theoretical concerns inherent in design choices for archaeology's computing infrastructure; collaboration through the development of new technologies that connect field-based researchers and specialists within an international archaeological community; and scholarly communications issues, with an emphasis on concerns over sustainability and preservation imperatives. This book not only describes practices that attempt to mitigate some of the problems associated with the Web, such as information overload and disinformation, it also presents compelling case studies of actual digital projects\textemdash many of which are rich in structured data and multimedia content or focused on generating content from the field ``in real time,'' and all of which demonstrate how the Web can and is being used to transform archaeological communications into forms that are more open, inclusive, and participatory. Above all, this volume aims to share these experiences to provide useful guidance for other researchers interested in applying technology to archaeology.},

Our discussion reports on how different editorial and collaborative review processes improved data documentation and quality, and created ontology annotations needed for comparative analyses by domain specialists. To prepare data for shared analysis, this project adapted editor-supervised review and revision processes familiar to conventional publishing, as well as more novel models of revision adapted from open source software development of public version control. Preparing the datasets for publication and analysis required significant investment of effort and expertise, including archaeological domain knowledge and familiarity with key ontologies. To organize this work effectively, we emphasized these different models of collaboration at various stages of this data publication and analysis project. Collaboration first centered on data editors working with data contributors, then widened to include other researchers who provided additional peer-review feedback, and finally the widest research community, whose collaboration is facilitated by GitHub's version control system. We demonstrate that the ``publish'' and ``push'' models of data dissemination need not be mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they can play complementary roles in sharing high quality data in support of research. This work highlights the value of combining multiple models in different stages of data dissemination.},

With the advent of new technologies, new methods, and new paradigms, archaeological research on regional space has undergone significant changes. This article reviews the state of regional archaeology, beginning with a consideration of its history and a discussion of the fundamental issues facing regional investigations before focusing on developments over the last several years. On one hand, the diversification of archaeological theory has created new paradigms for thinking about human relationships with one another and with the physical environment across regional space; in this regard, historical ecology, landscape archaeology, and evolutionary theory have been particularly influential in recent years. This has led to a corresponding diversification of the traditional methods of regional analysis. Most notably, the advent of powerful digital technologies has introduced new tools, especially those from the geographic information sciences, that build on the quantitative methods of past approaches. The investigation of regional data is no longer based on a discrete toolkit of simple mathematical and graphical procedures for representing spatial relationships. Instead, regional archaeology has matured into a diversity of multiscalar spatial and geostatistical techniques that inform many areas of archaeological inquiry.},

Sentinel-2 provides data of 10, 20 and 60 m, and it is a promising program for Earth observation studies. Although Sentinel-2 provides a high range of multispectral bands, the lack of panchromatic band disables the production of a set of fine-resolution (10 m) bands. However, few methods have been developed for increasing the spatial resolution of the 20 m bands up to 10 m. In this study, three different methods of producing panchromatic bands have been compared. The first method uses the closest higher spatial resolution band to the lowest spatial resolution band as a panchromatic band, the second method uses one single band as the panchromatic band produced as an average value out of all fine resolution bands, while the third method uses linear correlation for the selection of the panchromatic band. The 60 m bands have not been taken into consideration in this study. In order to compare these methods, three image fusion techniques from different fusion subsections (Component substitution\textemdash Intensity Hue Saturation IHS; Numerical method\textemdash High Pass Filter HPF; Hybrid Technique\textemdash Wavelet Principal Component WPC) have been applied on two Sentinel-2 images over the same study area, on different dates. For the accuracy assessment, both qualitative and quantitative analyses have been made. It has been concluded that using the average value of the visual and the near infrared bands can be accepted as a panchromatic band in the Sentinel-2 dataset.},

ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 is the latest SAR satellite providing multi-polarized L-band SAR data. With increasing deforestation, it is important to assess the potential of SAR data for identifying clear-cuts in forest regions. In this research work, multi-temporal ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 SAR data and supplementary Landsat-8 optical data sets are acquired over Indian tropical forest, and SAR parameters are analysed over a progressively clear-cut Teak plantation. Sensitivity of the SAR parameters to progressive clear-cuts is estimated and found that the cross-polarized backscatter {$\sigma$}HV0 and entropy parameter H are most sensitive to both partial and complete clear-cut in forest compartments. An entropy thresholding based classification is carried out to identify clear-cut regions with a good accuracy. The study highlights the utility of SAR parameters to monitor forest clear-cuts for better forest management.},

In this study, it is suggested that single boundary profiles are well represented by a two-parameter family of functions related to the Verhulst model for population growth. A curve of this type was fitted by an iterative technique to empirical data values provided by the distribution of various regional series of late Iron Age coinage in southern Britain, and preliminary results suggest that in most cases the boundaries identified correspond to those which have been inferred on the basis of historical evidence. In addition, the analysis has drawn attention to a number of features which might repay further study\textemdash a close relationship between boundaries and major rivers, and a suggestion of the existence of distinct boundary zones between discrete territorial units. There are, however, a number of problems in the application of the method, and further work is needed.},

Daily near-infrared (NIR) spectra from the AVHRR sensor with 1.1km spatial resolution and 8-dayNIR composites from the MODIS sensor with 250 m spatial resolution for the months April, July andSeptember were used as input data. The methodological approach uses temporal dynamic thresholdsfor individual data sets, which allows detection of water pixel independent from differing conditionsor sensor differences. The individual results are summed up and combined to monthly composites ofareal extent of water bodies. The presented water masks for the months April, July, and September werechosen to detect seasonal patterns as well as inter-annual dynamics and show diverse behaviour of static,decreasing, or dynamic water bodies in the study region. The size of the Southern Aral Sea, as the mostpopular example for an ecologic catastrophe, is decreasing significantly throughout all seasons (R20.96 forApril; 0.97 for July; 0.96 for September). Same is true for shallow natural lakes in the northern Kazakhstan,exemplary the Tengiz-Korgalzhyn lake system, which have been shrinking in the last two decades dueto drier conditions (R20.91 for July; 0.90 for September). On the contrary, water reservoirs show highseasonality and are very dynamic within one year in their areal extent with maximum before growingseason and minimum after growing season. Furthermore, there are water bodies such as Alakol-Sasykollake system and natural mountainous lakes which have been stable in their areal extent throughoutthe entire time period. Validation was performed based on several Landsat images with 30 m resolutionand reveals an overall accuracy of 83\% for AVHRR and 91\% for MODIS monthly water masks. The resultsshould assist for climatological and ecological studies, land and water management, and as input datafor different modelling applications. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We focus especially on surface survey as a means of documenting long-term settlement patterns at various scales, as an approach to the archaeology of regions, and as a pathway to the interpretation of past landscapes. Over the last decades, the literature on Mediterranean survey has increasingly emphasized a distinct set of practices, viewed both favorably and critically by regional archaeologists in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. We show that Mediterranean survey in fact comprises several discrete regional traditions. In general, these traditions have much to offer to wider dialogs in world archaeology, particularly concerning sampling and research design, the interpretation of surface assemblages, and the integration of complex, multidisciplinary datasets. More specifically, survey investigations of Mediterranean landscapes provide comparative data and potential research strategies of relevance to many issues of global significance, including human ecology, demography, urban\textendash rural dynamics, and various types of polity formation, colonialism, and imperialism.},

  abstract = {Volume contains papers presented on the workshop "Water for Assyria" with the framework of the tenth International Congress for Archaeology of the Ancient Near East (ICAANE) at the Austrian Academy of Science in Vienna, April 25-29, 2016. Lying within the range of 600 to 200 mm annual precipitation, the core region of Assyria (the ?heartland?) extends from the piedmont zone of the Zagros to the capital of Ashur. Scholars have maintained over decennia that water has never been of great economic significance for Assyria and that the Assyrians were unexperienced in hydraulic technology and water management. The Assyrian kings, foremost king Sennacherib (704?681 BC), were assumed to have constructed the water works of Nimrud and Nineveh for their royal gardens, pleasure, and prestige only. Assyrian water management outside the core region was unknown. 0The discovery of a supra-regional water guidance system in NE Syria in the 1980s, a comprehensive reevaluation of the Assyrian cuneiform sources in 2000, the application of remote sensing in landscape archaeology, and recent field work in the Kurdistan region of Iraq have generated a new assessment of Assyrian water skills and management. They demonstrate that the Assyrians had a long tradition of water engineering. Applying innovative technology like aqueducts, they invested in a large number of Grand Projects during the Middle and Neo-Assyrian Empires (c. 1350?612 BC), improving agricultural output, supply of drinking water for men and animals alike, growth of population, and transportation of goods and people. Presenting the results of ongoing projects, the authors of this volume offer insights into this exciting multi-disciplinary research field.

  abstract = {Despite holding the title of the `oldest continuously inhabited city in the world',  Damascus has seldom been the focus of academic research in urban studies. As  the city has been of prime importance to major historical Empires, this study of  Damascus' urban development reflects global shifts in culture, religion, and  economics over time. The problems Damascus faces today are in many ways  representative of those in other Less Developed Countries. Moreover, particularly  in the Middle East where factors such as oil and water supply come in to play, the  outcomes increasingly affect tomorrow's globalised world as a whole.  Currently the capital of a closed `market-socialist' economy, Damascus is now  attempting to reposition itself as a `modern' city, with various new reforms  paving the way for it to become a centre of trade, commerce and tourism.  However, it is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site whose proud status is under  threat as it disregards historical buildings, and struggles with one of the world's  highest urban growth rates, exacerbated inequality and endemic corruption.  Therefore, developers are faced with important questions: What does it mean to  be a modern city? In a Less Developed Economy, where should priorities lie?  To better understand Damascus' present situation, this paper provides an indepth  analytical study of the city's urban formation, from Ancient times until  today. It is written chronologically, taking into account changes in land tenure  policy, political environments and economic situations that have influenced  development. To provide a contemporary context, this paper also carries  interviews with key players in Syrian property development, including  developers, investors, academics and members of parliament. Further interviews  with architects, civil engineers and local Damascenes add local insight.  By placing these first-hand accounts within a historical socio-economic context,  this paper is a unique examination of Damascus and a useful reference for future  development.  Aside from government reforms to combat corruption, this paper concludes that  long-term, educated strategies need to be adopted to safeguard the city's  historical wealth, preserving social cohesion and its potential for tourism. New  industrial cities outside traditional urban areas would help manage high urban  populations, and reduce pressure on the fragile ecological basin of Damascus.},

  abstract = {Introduction Over the last few years, a new generation of satellite sensors has provided an unprecedented variety of remotely sensed imagery with a spatial resolution of 1 m and better. These images allow for the first time even small archaeological sites and features to be detected, which is a huge step forward for archaeological prospection: " For three decades archaeologists have waited for a high-resolution satellite capability and the arrival of satellites such as Ikonos and QuickBird signals a new era in research. " (Hung 2006: 680). Since about 2004, when the 1 st International Conference on Remote Sensing Archaeology was organised by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, specific conferences have helped to promote research in this new scientific domain. These include the 2 nd and 3 rd International Conferences on Remote Sensing Archaeology in Rome (2006) and Tiruchirappalli (2009), the 1 st International Workshop on Advances in Remote Sensing for Archaeology and Cultural Heritage Management in Rome (October 2008), the DECARS meeting in Amsterdam in April 2009, as well as special sessions at AARG, CAA, ISPRS, CIPA, SPIE and other conferences. Archaeologists have been quick in realizing the great potential of high-resolution digital satellite imagery for the detection and documentation of archaeological sites and features. A growing number of case studies with interesting results have evolved from ongoing archaeological field projects in recent years. While some of these projects have been limited to a visual inspection of images to aid fieldwork, others now go beyond this level by applying advanced methods of digital image analysis in order to extract archaeological information. These methods include, among others, multispectral analysis, image classification, pattern recognition, photogrammetry, and related approaches. However, a systematic evaluation of the potential of these methods, which were usually developed for different kinds of applications in the geo and bio sciences, and the potential of the new data source itself remains a desideratum. At the same time, important progress has been made in the processing and analysis of declassified high-resolution analogue photographs acquired by Corona and other spy satellites in the 1960-80s. Especially when analysed in conjunction with other images, these photographs have proven to be yet another valuable new data source for archaeological prospection. During the 2009 CAA conference (Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology, see www.caa2009.org) in Williamsburg, USA (the capital of Virginia from 1699 to 1780 and today the nation's largest outdoor living history museum), we organised a special session that aimed to explore the potential and limitations of high-resolution digital satellite imagery, and of current methods of digital image analysis with regard to the requirements of archaeological prospection. Our session was entitled Archaeological prospecting using high-resolution digital satellite imagery: recent advances and future},

During their exile, some produced art and crafted objects inspired by their environment or past experiences, which offer a powerful insight into the Commune and its aftermath, a revolutionary attempt long perceived as "without images" (Tillier 2004). Furthermore, the Communards' stay in New Caledonia nourished the regular (non-political) convicts' arts and crafts, maintaining caricature, satire and hidden messages on the artefacts, long after the return of the exiled. Thus, we can still identify pieces in link with the revolutionary/anarchist discourse of the Paris Commune, although crafted as late as 1910-1920. The legacy of the Communards to the history of New Caledonia thus goes beyond their literary production, which has until now been the main focus of academic research.},

In the managerial university and in the context of expanding HE, teaching has become a more complex, more problematised and more managed activity. This article approaches identity as identification on different levels of academic work and asks: What values and conceptions of teaching work do academics identify with? What kind of elements strengthen or constrain the teacher identity of academics? Research data consist of 14 in-depth interviews with eleven academics at one Finnish multidisciplinary university. Academics recognised meaningful and rewarding elements of teaching work and also pointed out problems and tensions associated with being a teacher. Those elements informing academic teacher identity often appeared to be empowering and constraining at the same time. Furthermore, the perceptions and experiences of interviewees were strongly contextualised. Obviously, academic teacher identity is more a local question than that of researcher identity.},

Recently, the introduction of more advanced software and hardware solutions have made it possible to use GIS for visualizing and analysing even geometrically complex 3D contents, in a totally unprecedented way. Still, a theoretical debate on the way three-dimensionality could impact GIS-based research has yet to come and only a few pioneering projects have been conducted to show the potential for the discipline. Among the possible lines of enquiry to be developed in this direction, sensory archaeology seems to be one to benefit more from such an approach.

The site is located on the western bank of the Tigris river about 100 km southeast of the modern city of D\i yarbakir. During the 10 years of archaeological work performed at the site 11 archaeological phases were recorded starting from the fourth millennium BC until the XIXth century AD. This volume represents the nal report on the studies of the material culture belonging to this long chrono- logical sequence that was unearthed during the excavations and aims at allowing the interested scholars at reconstructing the history of the settlement as well as a broader sociocultural landscape that involved other social groups inhabiting the upper Tigris region as well as other Anatolian and Mesopotamian regions.},

  abstract = {The consolidation of the scientific publishing industry has been the topic of much debate within and outside the scientific community, especially in relation to major publishers' high profit margins. However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor \& Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50\% of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70\% of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20\% from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing.},

  abstract = {Across the world, many university-based early career researchers (ECRs) are experiencing an unprecedented intensification of research expectations on transition from doctoral research to academic life. Countries such as Australia have put into place national frameworks of research excellence to remain globally competitive. Pressure on universities to elevate global research rankings has soared, with many regional universities and disciplines such as education responding with a rapid escalation of research performance expectations for academics. Consequently, concerns have been raised for ECRs embroiled in intensified research agendas in these contexts. Framed by concepts of liminality and identity construction, we argue that intensified expectations do not take account of liminality experienced by ECRs during times of transition, compromising perceived academic progress. We report on the identity journeys of ECRs in a School of Education at one regional Australian university. Data was collected from nine ECRs using online focus groups and analysed using a hybrid thematic approach. Key findings indicate that ECRs transition into the Academy post-doctorate with varying experiences of identity liminality that impact their capacity to manage research expectations. ECRs experiencing shorter periods of liminality are best positioned to manage the intensified expectations of academic life while ECRs experiencing persistent liminality and identity `struggle' are more likely to perceive a diminished sense of achievement and support. These findings have significant implications for university leadership and research supervisors, in Australia and globally, regarding the ways they support ECRs to productively navigate the hyper-invigilated audit cultures of what we have termed the neo-academy.},

Part of his task was to start excavations at Nineveh, in particular on the huge mound known as Kuyunjik, and Mohl had secured funds specifically for this purpose. Austen Henry Layard first turned his attention to Kuyunjik, where, having better luck than Botta, he had made some significant discoveries during his earlier expedition; most importantly, he had found there a vast palace built by Sennacherib around 700 BCE. One of Layard's most important achievements at Kuyunjik was the discovery of a large room filled with mostly fragmentary clay tablets covered with cuneiform writing.},

Multitemporal Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data sets have been processed to assess their capability in the detection of buried archeological remains related to some lost sections of the ancient Via Appia road (herein selected as case study). The very subtle and nonpermanent features linked to buried archeological remains can be captured using multitemporal (intra- and inter-year) satellite acquisitions, but this requires strong hardware infrastructures or cloud facilities, today also available as open and free tools as Google Earth Engine (GEE). In this study, a total of 2948 Sentinel 1 and 743 Sentinel 2 images were selected (from February 2017 to August 2020) and processed using GEE to enhance and unveil archeological features. Outputs obtained from both Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 have been successfully compared with in situ analysis and high-resolution Google Earth images.},

However, few regional studies have systematically integrated satellite-based observations with more intensive remote sensing technologies, such as drone-deployed multispectral sensors and ground-based geophysics, to explore off-site areas. Here, we integrate remote sensing data from a variety of sources and scales including historic aerial photographs, modern satellite imagery, drone-deployed sensors, and ground-based geophysics to explore pre-modern land use along the Upper Diyala/Sirwan River in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Our analysis reveals an incredible diversity of land use features, including canals, qanats, trackways, and field systems, most of which likely date to the first millennium CE, and demonstrate the potential of more intensive remote sensing methods to resolve land use features. Our results align with broader trends across ancient Southwest Asia that document the most intensive land use in the first millennium BCE through the first millennium CE. Land use features dating to the earlier Bronze Age (fourth through second millennium BCE) remain elusive and will likely require other investigative approaches.},

However, the vast majority of these remote sensing cultural heritage monitoring efforts have been led and conducted by remote researchers, and there remains an urgent need to embed this work within existing, in-country institutions at local and regional levels. Here, we present the archaeological site monitoring approach and results from the project Archaeological Practice and Heritage Protection in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, a collaborative project between the Sirwan Regional Project and Kurdish Iraqi archaeologists aimed at generating a fully functional and sustainable programme of archaeological site management co-created with, and managed by, Kurdish Iraqi archaeologists and antiquities officials. Between August 2018 and February 2020, 376 archaeological sites in the Sirwan/Upper Diyala River Valley region, located in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, were assessed for damage by Kurdish Iraqi archaeologists in collaboration with the Sirwan Regional Project. This work represents the first large-scale, systematic dataset of archaeological site conditions and longer-term damage in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Our results show that 86.7\% of the assessed archaeological sites and 38.6\% of the site surface area in this region were affected by damage between 1951\textendash 2018, and demonstrate the great urgency with which action must be taken to develop appropriate safeguarding measures for the KRI's archaeological heritage. On the basis of these results, we outline relevant recommendations for the immediate protection of archaeological sites in Garmian and the greater Kurdistan Region.},

We also explore how archaeologists interviewed for Heath-Stout's dissertation study of diversity issues in the discipline have navigated finding field experiences. We argue that scholarships are an ineffective and insufficient means of promoting equity and accessibility in the field because the root of the problem lies in institutionalized inequality and exclusivity. We provide strategies that students and faculty can use to address these problems on both individual and systemic levels. By making field schools affordable and accessible to a more diverse set of undergraduate students, we can create a more just and inclusive discipline.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the development of urban centres in the Northern Fertile Crescent during the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age and seeks to place this development in a wider context of landscape transformation over time. Settlement data from eight archaeological surveys covering a range of landscape types and environments are brought into a single interpretive framework, organised through a Geographical Information System (GIS). These surveys are enhanced through the use of satellite imagery, particularly Corona spy photography, to discover new sites both within and outside the boundaries of their original areas. Methods for the incorporation of this wide range of data are developed, including the use of concepts such as `certainty' and `precision' and techniques for the comparison of multiple chronological systems.  These new methods are used to undertake a multi-scalar examination of settlement trajectories from the 5th to the 3rd millennium. Two phases of urban development are evident, first in the Late Chalcolithic and then during the `second urban revolution' (Akkermans and Schwartz 2003) in the later Early Bronze Age. Whilst the Late Chalcolithic centres emerged within dense landscapes of small settlements, urbanisation in the later Early Bronze Age was accompanied by the widespread incursion of settlement into a `zone of uncertainty' on the margins of the steppe. It is argued that a combination of factors, including the shift from flax to wool as the raw material in textile production and the development of social institutions capable of bearing risks at a large scale, provided the incentive and the means for this expansion, and that this transformed the societies of the region as a whole. This phenomenon is then placed in the wider context of long-term landscape change. It is argued that differences in settlement histories across the region can account for variations in the preservation of the archaeological record.},

Academia, however, has changed dramatically in the last few decades: it has become larger and more demographically diverse, and fears of overspecialization prompt calls for interdisciplinary approaches. In this new environment, other factors, in addition to productivity, are likely relevant to our understanding of earnings differentials. In this article, I assess whether two additional factors?visibility and the extent of research specialization?contribute to men's earning advantage. Using probability samples of tenure-track academics in two disciplines, a variety of data sources, and innovative measures, I find that both factors are highly relevant to the process by which earnings are determined. Women earn less than men largely because they specialize less. Lower levels of specialization hinder productivity, productivity enhances visibility, and visibility has a direct, positive, and significant effect on salary. I discuss the practical implications of these findings and lay the foundation for a broader theory of the role of research specialization in work processes.},

  abstract = {To study the Earth system and to better understand the implications of global environmental change, there is a growing need for large-scale hydrographic data sets that serve as prerequisites in a variety of analyses and applications, ranging from regional watershed and freshwater conservation planning to global hydrological, climate, biogeochemical, and land surface modeling. Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped.In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape. The new product, known as HydroSHEDS (Hydrological Data and Maps Based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at Multiple Scales), provides this information at a resolution and quality unachieved by previous global data sets, such as HYDRO1k [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 2000].},

  abstract = {Despite the recognized importance of reservoirs and dams, global datasets describing their characteristics and geographical distribution are largely incomplete. To enable advanced assessments of the role and effects of dams within the global river network and to support strategies for mitigating ecohydrological and socioeconomic costs, we introduce here the spatially explicit and hydrologically linked Global Reservoir and Dam database (GRanD). As of early 2011, GRanD contains information regarding 6862 dams and their associated reservoirs, with a total storage capacity of 6197 km 3. On the basis of these records, we estimate that about 16.7 million reservoirs larger than 0.01 ha - with a combined storage capacity of approximately 8070 km 3 - may exist worldwide, increasing Earth's terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km 2. We find that 575 900 river kilometers, or 7.6\% of the world's rivers with average flows above 1 cubic meter per second (m 3 s -1), are affected by a cumulative upstream reservoir capacity that exceeds 2\% of their annual flow; the impact is highest for large rivers with average flows above 1000 m 3 s -1, of which 46.7\% are affected. Finally, a sensitivity analysis suggests that smaller reservoirs have substantial impacts on the spatial extent of flow alterations despite their minor role in total reservoir capacity. \textcopyright{} The Ecological Society of America.},

Through new applications such as Collect Earth, this imagery is also being used for monitoring purposes in the form of statistical surveys obtained through visual interpretation. However, little is known about where VHR satellite imagery exists globally or the dates of the imagery. Here we present a global overview of the spatial and temporal distribution of VHR satellite imagery in Google Earth and Microsoft Bing Maps. The results show an uneven availability globally, with biases in certain areas such as the USA, Europe and India, and with clear discontinuities at political borders. We also show that the availability of VHR imagery is currently not adequate for monitoring protected areas and deforestation, but is better suited for monitoring changes in cropland or urban areas using visual interpretation.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing has more advantages than the traditional methods of land surface water (LSW) mapping because it is a low-cost, reliable information source that is capable of making high-frequency and repeatable observations. The normalized difference water indexes (NDWIs), calculated from various band combinations (green, near-infrared (NIR), or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)), have been successfully applied to LSW mapping. In fact, new NDWIs will become available when Advanced Land Imager (ALI) data are used as the ALI sensor provides one green band (Band 4), two NIR bands (Bands 6 and 7), and three SWIR bands (Bands 8, 9, and 10). Thus, selecting the optimal band or combination of bands is critical when ALI data are employed to map LSW using NDWI. The purpose of this paper is to find the best performing NDWI model of the ALI data in LSW map. In this study, eleven NDWI models based on ALI, Thematic Mapper (TM), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were compared to assess the performance of ALI data in LSW mapping, at three different study sites in the Yangtze River Basin, China. The contrast method, Otsu method, and confusion matrix were calculated to evaluate the accuracies of the LSW maps. The accuracies of LSW maps derived from eleven NDWI models showed that five NDWI models of the ALI sensor have more than an overall accuracy of 91\% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.78 of LSW maps at three test sites. In addition, the NDWI model, calculated from the green (Band 4: 0.525-0.605 {$\mu$}m) and SWIR (Band 9: 1.550-1.750 {$\mu$}m) bands of the ALI sensor, namely NDWIA4,9, was shown to have the highest LSW mapping accuracy, more than the other NDWI models. Therefore, the NDWIA4,9 is the best indicator for LSW mapping of the ALI sensor. It can be used for mapping LSW with high accuracy.. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the authors.},

Combining this massive database with the parallel computing power of Google's infrastructure facilitates quick and easy analysis of satellite imagery on any scale, opening new avenues for research in a number of fields. This paper evaluates the potential role GEE can play in the future of archaeological research. To do so, GEE was employed/tested in two case studies. First, GEE was used to automatically identify specific archaeological features across the landscape of the archaeologically-rich Faynan region of Southern Jordan. Second, GEE-based edge-detection and automatic vectorization for mapping archaeological sites was tested at the Iron Age (ca. 1200\textendash 900BCE) site of Khirbat al-Jariya in Faynan. Based on the test results, the authors concluded that GEE has significant potential for assisting archaeologists with automated feature detection and vectorization, tasks that are often onerous and expensive.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is an effective technology for monitoring water resources. However, many methods in remote sensing imagery used to identify open bodies of water have often been shown to produce varying water body classification results for the same bodies of water. Therefore, it is necessary to have measures to assess these methods. In this study, we used datasets collected in the field to assess methods for identifying open water bodies using images from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager. From this, we clarified the difference in the performance between the use of spectral reflectance images and that of digital number (DN) value images for the classification of water bodies. The results showed that the normalized difference water index (NDWI), calculated using green and near-infrared bands (NDWIGreen/NIR) with reflectance, captured correct control points with an accuracy of greater than 95~\% and was therefore the superior method. The result of a comparison in performance in terms of the NDWI between reflectance images and DN value images was consistent with their initial definitions. The NDWI indices calculated by the initial definitions yielded more reasonable results in the classification of water bodies. The optimized threshold, calibrated and validated by 737 field control points, generated water classification results with a higher confidence in this study. We think that it might be better to set the optimized threshold of NDWIGreen/NIR to -0.05 instead of the value of zero used in many studies. However, more optimized thresholds for other regions need to be calibrated and confirmed if data are available. Our results indicated that NDWI methods are more suitable for water body classification than single-band methods when the frequency histogram method is used.},

  abstract = {It has been a quarter of a century since the last detailed study of the area of Damascus in the ancient period appeared in print. Several new discoveries have been made, which give us a clearer picture of this important kingdom, and it is now appropriate to reinvestigate the previously known Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Hittite and biblical references to it in light of these recent discoveries and try to integrate the material into a new synthesis.    After an introductory chapter, chapter two examines the few sources from the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1550 B.C.E.) which are purported to mention the area of Damascus (known at that time as the land of(' )'Apum).    Chapter three attempts to reconstruct the role of the area of Damascus in the rise of the Egyptian Empire under the New Kingdom pharaohs and in the developing power struggle between Egypt and the Hittites for the control of Syria-Palestine.    Chapter four deals with the transitional period of ca. 1200-931, when the state of Upi developed into an Aramaean state. The conquest of Damascus by David and the gaining of its independence during the reign of Solomon are discussed here.    Chapter five covers the period from ca. 931-844, the years in which Damascus gained great political stature. Discussions of the question of whether Hezion, the grandfather of Bir-Hadad I, and Rezon, who rebelled against Solomon, are the same person, and of the attack of Bir-Hadad I on northern Israel and its date, are followed by major analyses of the reign of Hadad-('c)idr and the question of the identity of the king of Damascus who was murdered by the usurper Hazael.    The final chapter follows the events of the reign of Hazael, probably the most powerful king of Aram Damascus, and the decline of the state under Hazael's son, Bir-Hadad III. The dissertation concludes with an analysis of the reign of the last king of the independent state of Aram Damascus, Radyan, and the capture of Damascus by Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria in 732 B.C.E.},

The idea of continuity from one king or dynasty to the next survives in the so-called ``Akkadian Prophecies'' as well as the ``Dynastic Prophecy'', which describes the succession from the Assyrian Empire to the Neo-Babylonian Empire to the Persian Empire and, finally, to the Macedonian-Seleucid Empires. The idea of translatio imperii was based on the concept that there was only one ``empire'' at a time. This chapter investigates the practical as well as ideological implications of this reasoning. It discusses imperial ideology and its role in the Neo-Assyrian Period. The chapter explores the political theology of Assyria that changed around the mid-second millennium BCE. It distinguishes between two different stages, a first one providing certain prerequisites, and a second stage bringing about the actualization of the imperial project.},

The most important work of Old Assyrian literature that has come down to us so far is a well preserved and substantial text of sixty-three lines from Kultepe (Kanis) that describes the deeds of the Old Akkadian king Sargon. Since the language of the text is Old Assyrian and it was found among a sea of mercantile documents at Kanis, it is legitimate to include it under the rubric of Old Assyrian literature. The Neo-Assyrian tradition of ``literature'' in the strict sense begins under Sargon II, who commissioned a hymn to Nanaya with blessings for himself. True to type for the warrior king the hymn dwells on the warlike aspect of the goddess's character as well as the essential nature of her involvement in all human activity.},

More specifically, we present a way to elicit and interpret pottery surface assemblages from Mallorca's Late Iron Age, the Balearic Period (550 -1 BCE) recovered during the 2014-18 seasons of the Landscape, Encounters and Identity Archaeological project (LEIAp). To achieve this goal, we derive a new binary (pseudo-) metric or dissimilarity coefficient that in combination with a spectral biclustering algorithm allows us to group areas on the landscape with similar pottery assemblages. This new metric better aligns with our intuition about the similarities between pottery assemblages than other well-known binary metrics. Careful examination of the composition of the groups obtained from clustering enables us to forward interpretations regarding activities that occurred at various non-monumental enclaves throughout the landscape. These results provide a more nuanced view of the landscape during this period of time, in particular, by exposing the existence of non-monumental domestic spaces and areas destined to transport and farming activities.},

Just as this applied to people living in the past, so it applies to those of us concerned with trying to understand those past lives through the archaeological record. Most, if not all, archaeological material has a spatial component and it is not surprising, therefore, that spatial thinking has been central within archaeological endeavour since the beginnings of the discipline. Specific forms of spatial thinking have changed with developing theory and methods and with changing analytical and technological opportunities resulting in the rich variety of approaches available to us today. Within this development, the rapid adoption of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology since the early 1990s has had a major impact on archaeology and related disciplines and its use is now almost taken for granted. Although the use of GIS in archaeology has always been, and still is contentious at the theoretical level, the attractions of the technology are usually seen to outweigh any restrictions or disadvantages. In this paper we situate the use of GIS, including the papers in this volume, within the wider arena of spatial thinking in archaeology in an attempt to assess the impact that this technology has had on how we think spatially.},

This non-technical introductory volume discusses and explains the influence of computers on all aspects of archaeological research and interpretation, from survey, excavation and landscape to museums, education and communicating the past. The author meets the need of the archaeologist to keep abreast of how computers can assist at all stages of archaeological research and data analysis. Theoretical information, focusing on Geographical Information Systems, for example, is presented through description of archaeological processes, and is consistently practical and free from jargon. The author acknowledges the problem of obsolescence in computing and presents archaeological technology as an on-going, constantly changing process rather than as a final, achievable state. The book will thus remain relevant through future advances in technology and informative about the general principles of, and the issues arising from, the relationship between computers and archaeology. Highly illustrated and referenced throughout with case-studies and examples, Using Computers in Archaeology: Towards Virtual Pasts is a timely survey of this increasingly important area of archaeology, catering for both the student and the experienced archaeologist.},

Several tells, ancient mounds of towns or villages, have been identified, surveyed and mapped in the region. Our aim is to study short-term variations of the river channel with satellite images in order to trace some scales and tempo of the channel changes that may also have affected the past occupation. Our aim is to find out, how the acquired information can be combined for the purpose of interpreting the archaeological evidence of the past occupation, even the landscape of historical events in the area. Satellite images used in this study consists of declassified CORONA satellite photographs from 1966, Landsat MSS (1983), Landsat TM (1990) and ETM (1999 and 2001) images. SPOT images covering the research area are used for mapping tells and for evidence of the present situation of the river valley. The interpretation of the water areas is based on the cluster analysis and visual interpretation. The topographic variations of the river channel are visualized using colour coding of DEMs and plots of the cross sections of the river channel. An Aster image from USGS has been used to produce DEM in order to study the cross-section of the river valley.},

  abstract = {Landsat 8, originally known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) partnership that continues the legacy of continuous moderate resolution observations started in 1972. The conception of LDCM to the reality of Landsat 8 followed an arduous path extending over nearly 13years, but the successful launch on February 11, 2013 ensures the continuity of the unparalleled Landsat record. The USGS took over mission operations on May 30, 2013 and renamed LCDM to Landsat 8. Access to Landsat 8 data was opened to users worldwide. Three years following launch we evaluate the science and applications impact of Landsat 8. With a mission objective to enable the detection and characterization of global land changes at a scale where differentiation between natural and human-induced causes of change is possible, LDCM promised incremental technical improvements in capabilities needed for Landsat scientific and applications investigations. Results show that with Landsat 8, we are acquiring more data than ever before, the radiometric and geometric quality of data are generally technically superior to data acquired by past Landsat missions, and the new measurements, e.g., the coastal aerosol and cirrus bands, are opening new opportunities. Collectively, these improvements are sparking the growth of science and applications opportunities. Equally important, with Landsat 7 still operational, we have returned to global imaging on an 8-daycycle, a capability that ended when Landsat 5 ceased operational Earth imaging in November 2011. As a result, the Landsat program is on secure footings and planning is underway to extend the record for another 20 or more years.},

We suggest that the varied investments from international expeditions, conservation programs, and technical assistance in Syria have an important, untold history that is relevant to recent developments and conflicts in northern Syria. We explore the intersecting practices of archaeology and assistance, illuminated by archives drawn from international agencies such as UNESCO, as well as companies, consultants, bureaucrats, and archaeologists. Our focus is upon foreign intervention around imperiled heritage, considering not only internal politics but also UNESCO's 1960s shift from fully funded campaigns to global appeals reliant on foreign governments, corporations, and universities. The outsourcing of salvage allowed specific patrons\textendash national and international\textendash to privilege particular pasts; and it is these histories and legacies that further require us to reassess the place of Raqqa in the current civil war.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the use of the Chinese Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite imagery to automatically extract tertiary Linear Archaeological Traces of Tuntian Irrigation Canals (LATTICs) located in the Miran site. The site is adjacent to the ancient Loulan Kingdom at the eastern margin of the Taklimakan Desert in western China. GF-1 data were processed following atmospheric and geometric correction, and spectral analyses were carried out for multispectral data. The low values produced by spectral separability index (SSI) indicate that it is difficult to distinguish buried tertiary LATTICs from similar backgrounds using spectral signatures. Thus, based on the textual characteristics of high-resolution GF-1 panchromatic data, this paper proposes an automatic approach that combines joint morphological bottom and hat transformation with a Canny edge operator. The operator was improved by adding stages of geometric filtering and gradient vector direction analysis. Finally, the detected edges of tertiary LATTICs were extracted using the GIS-based draw tool and converted into shapefiles for archaeological mapping within a GIS environment. The proposed automatic approach was verified with an average accuracy of 95.76\% for 754 tertiary LATTICs in the entire Miran site and compared with previous manual interpretation results. The results indicate that GF-1 VHR PAN imagery can successfully uncover the ancient tuntian agricultural landscape. Moreover, the proposed method can be generalized and applied to extract linear archaeological traces such as soil and crop marks in other geographic locations.},

  abstract = {Google Earth (GE), a large Earth-observation data-based geographical information computer application, is an intuitive three-dimensional virtual globe. It enables archaeologists around the world to communicate and share their multisource data and research findings. Different from traditional geographical information systems (GIS), GE is free and easy to use in data collection, exploration, and visualization. In the past decade, many peer-reviewed articles on the use of GE in the archaeological cultural heritage (ACH) research field have been published. Most of these concern specific ACH investigations with a wide spatial coverage. GE can often be used to survey and document ACH so that both skilled archaeologists and the public can more easily and intuitively understand the results. Based on geographical tools and multi-temporal very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, GE has been shown to provide spatio-temporal change information that has a bearing on the physical, environmental, and geographical character of ACH. In this review, in order to discuss the huge potential of GE, a comprehensive review of GE and its applications to ACH in the published scientific literature is first presented; case studies in five main research fields demonstrating how GE can be deployed as a key tool for studying ACH are then described. The selected case studies illustrate how GE can be used effectively to investigate ACH at multiple scales, discover new archaeological sites in remote regions, monitor historical sites, and assess damage in areas of conflict, and promote virtual tourism. These examples form the basis for highlighting current trends in remote sensing archaeology based on the GE platform, which could provide access to a low-cost and easy-to-use tool for communicating and sharing ACH geospatial data more effectively to the general public in the era of Digital Earth. Finally, a discussion of the merits and limitations of GE is presented along with conclusions and remaining challenges.},

The most prominent use of cuneiform writing for a language other than Sumerian was for Akkadian, which comprises both Assyrian and Babylonian dialects.

The chapter focuses on the main features of the Assyrian dialect and some of the changes that occurred between Old, Middle, and Neo-Assyrian.

The channel forms in an alluvial plain reflecting the movement of water and the particle size of the load flowing down the channel. The dynamics of channel change has led to conflict with human resource development. Three basic channel patterns are detected in the region. They are braided, meandering and straight. In this research for assessment of meandering Maroon River, we used DEM (Digital Elevation System), Topography maps, Arc GIS software, Google earth, field work and library studies and mathematic formula. The two general indices for analyzing meandering patterns are 1) sinuosity coefficient 2) central angle. In this paper, the authors were used these factors and improved them. One of the results is creation of direction index and the second result is the Maroon River which has a type of sinuosity in any reach.},

  abstract = {Agricultural productivity, and its variation in space and time, plays a fundamental role in many theories of human social evolution. However, we often lack systematic information about the productivity of past agricultural systems on a large enough scale in order to be able to test these theories properly. The effect of climate on crop yields has received a great deal of attention resulting in a range of empirical and process-based models, yet the focus has primarily been on current or future conditions. In this paper, we argue for a ``bottom-up'' approach that estimates productivity, or potential productivity based on information about the agricultural practices and technologies used in past societies. Of key theoretical interest is using this information to estimate the carrying capacity of a given region, independently of estimates of population size. We outline how explicit crop yield models can be combined with high quality historical and archaeological information about past societies, in order to infer the temporal and geographic patterns of change in agricultural productivity and potential. We discuss the kinds of information we need to collect about agricultural techniques and practices in the past, and introduce a new databank initiative we have developed for collating the best available historical and archaeological evidence. A key benefit of our approach lies in making explicit the steps in the process of estimating past productivities and carrying capacities, and in being able to assess the effects of different modelling assumptions. This is undoubtedly an ambitious task, yet promises to provide important insights into fundamental aspects of past societies, and will enable us to test more rigorously key hypotheses about human socio-cultural evolution.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a detailed assessment on the impact of dams on archaeological sites in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and emphasizes the lack of established protocols for documenting and preserving cultural heritage at the local, national and international level. We considered four case studies at different scales \textendash{} Turkey, the Euphrates river, the two Aswan dams and the planned Makhul dam \textendash{} in order to identify different issues related to the construction of dams as well as to propose some best practices for pre-flooding assessment of dam impact on cultural heritage. Our method integrates archaeological and geo-spatial open-access datasets, organized in a GIS environment made available through the online platform http://www.orientlab.net/orientdams/ in order to foster data sharing and research replicability. We have mapped almost 2500 flooded archaeological sites and approximately 1300 km of ancient rivers submerged by dam reservoirs in the selected case studies across the MENA area. These numbers are actually incomplete, since large portions of the reservoir areas have not been systematically investigated. We conclude by underlining the urgent need for strategies for the documentation and protection of archaeological sites and monuments in the planning of hydraulic infrastructures at the international, national and local levels, as well as the need for a general operative protocol. Funders of development works, first and foremost the World Bank, should review their current policies, which do not offer sufficient protection of cultural heritage.},

In analyzing as a case study three major reservoirs in the Middle Euphrates river valley in southeastern Turkey (Atat\"urk, Birecik and Karkam\i\c{s}), we developed a Post-Flooding Damage Assessment (PFDA) to evaluate the impact of dams on archaeological sites. Our PFDA, consisting of an analysis of cross-correlations between multi-temporal Landsat imagery, geographical spatial datasets and archaeological data from surveys and excavations, provides an unprecedented detailed overview of the loss of especially significant cultural landscapes, and also highlights the limited accuracy of pre-flooding archaeological surveys and excavations. We conclude with recommendations for improving how rescue archaeological projects targeting endangered cultural landscapes are designed, with an immediately achievable target of better documenting cultural heritage threatened by dams.},

  abstract = {The exact location and evolution of Tyre's ancient harbour areas have been matters of scholarly conjecture since the 16th century. Here, we use geoscience techniques to precisely relocate the ancient northern harbour, the city's principal transport hub during antiquity, and reconstruct its geomorphological evolution (Marriner, N., Morhange, C., Boudagher-Fadel, M., Bourcier, M., Carbonel, P., 2005. Geoarchaeology of Tyre's ancient northern harbour, Phoenicia. Journal of Archaeological Science 32, 1302e1327.). While a natural anchorage is inferred during the Bronze Age, we expound the increasing weight of anthropogenic forcings from the Iron Age onwards, culminating in a technological apogee during the Byzantine period (Hohlfelder, R.L., 1997. Building harbours in the early Byzantine era: the persistence of Roman technology. Byzantinische Forschungen Internationale Zeitschrift fu\textasciidieresis r Byzantinistik 24, 367e389.).

Initial development of Ras Ibn Hani's coastal system began \textasciitilde. 8000. years ago when shallow marine environments formed in a context of rising post-glacial sea level. Following relative sea-level stabilization \textasciitilde. 6000. cal. yr BP, beach facies trace the gradual formation of a wave-dominated sandbank fronted by a \textasciitilde. 2300. \texttimes. \textasciitilde. 500. m palaeo-island whose environmental potentiality was attractive to Bronze Age societies. A particularly rapid phase of tombolo accretion is observed after \textasciitilde. 3500. cal. yr BP characterised by a two- to fourfold increase in sedimentation rates. This is consistent with (i) a pulse in sediment supply probably driven by Bronze Age/Iron Age soil erosion in local catchments, and (ii) positive feedback mechanisms linked to regionally attested neotectonics. Archaeological remains and radiocarbon datings confirm that the subaerial tombolo was probably in place by the Late Bronze Age. These data fit tightly with other eastern Mediterranean tombolo systems suggesting that there is a great deal of predictability to their geology and stratigraphy at the regional scale. \textcopyright{} 2012 University of Washington.},

The site of Sela on the southern Transjordan plateau is unique for understanding water management in this semi-arid area. The analysis of hydraulic installations has allowed us to characterise its hydro technology and spatial distribution in the settlement. To this end, the hydraulic facilities have been identified, documented, and analysed in detail through two archaeological surveys (2015 and 2016). Spatial analysis has been carried out by preparing extensive 2D planimetry and 3D reconstructions. The results obtained have made it possible to reconstruct the water supply system necessary for the subsistence of the societies that inhabited Sela over time. The system consists of canals, cisterns, and sedimentation basins for the collection, conduction, storage, and preservation of water, mainly from rain. Some of Sela's hydraulic structures may have originated in the Bronze Age (mid-late 2nd mill. BCE), but more secure dating is needed to substantiate this possibility.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the activities performed at the Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to derive global forest/non-forest classification mosaics from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data acquired by the TanDEM-X mission. The data have been collected between 2011 and 2016 in bistatic stripmap single polarization (HH) mode, with the main goal of generating a consistent, timely, and highly accurate 3D representation of the global terrain's surface (digital elevation model, DEM). The global data set of quicklook images, which represent a spatially averaged version of the original full resolution data at a ground independent pixel spacing of 50 m \texttimes{} 50 m, was used as input, in order to limit the computational burden. For classification purposes, several observables, systematically provided by the TanDEM-X system, can be exploited, such as the calibrated amplitude, the digital elevation model (DEM), and the interferometric coherence. Among the several factors contributing to a coherence degradation in InSAR data, the so-called volume correlation factor quantifies the coherence loss due to volume scattering phenomena, which typically occur in presence of vegetation. This quantity is directly derived from the interferometric coherence and used as main indicator for the identification of vegetated areas. For this purpose, a fuzzy multi-clustering classification approach, which takes into account the geometry and acquisition configuration, is applied to each acquired scene separately. A certain variability of the interferometric coherence at X band was observed among different forest types, mainly due to changes in forest structure, density, and tree height, which led to an adjustment of the algorithm settings depending on the considered type of forest. The identification of additional information layers, such as urban settlements or water areas, is also discussed, and the procedure for mosaicking of overlapping acquisitions (two at global scale, up to ten over mountainous terrain, forests, and desert regions) to improve the classification accuracy is detailed. The resulting global forest/non-forest map was validated using external reference information as well as with other existing classification maps and an overall agreement was observed that often exceeds 90\%. Finally, examples for high-resolution (at 12 m \texttimes{} 12 m) forest maps and potentials for deforestation monitoring over selected regions are presented as well, demonstrating the unique capabilities offered by the TanDEM-X bistatic system for a broad range of geoinformation services and scientific applications. The global TanDEM-X forest/non-forest map presented in this paper will be made available to the scientific community for free download and usage.},

We review what data are, according to current influential definitions, and previous work on the benefits, costs, and norms of data sharing in the sciences broadly. To understand data sharing in archaeology, we present the results of three pilot studies: requests for data by e-mail, review of data availability in published articles, and analysis of archaeological datasets deposited in repositories. We find that archaeologists are often willing to share but that discipline-wide sharing is patchy and ad hoc. Legislation and mandates are effective at increasing data sharing, but editorial policies at journals lack adequate enforcement. Although most of the data available at repositories are licensed to enable flexible reuse, only a small proportion of the data are stored in structured formats for easy reuse. We present some suggestions for improving the state of date sharing in archaeology; among these is a standard for citing datasets to ensure that researchers making their data publicly available receive appropriate credit., \textquestiondown C\'omo comparten los arque\'ologos sus datos de investigaci\'on, si lo hacen?

We briefly review the origins of these terms and explore their relevance for archaeology, with special consideration of Southeast Asia. To minimize over-research and ethics dumping in archaeology we propose some modest, specific activities that should be possible for all archaeologists to do to increase the benefit of their research to local communities, and to ensure their work is consistent with international ethical standards.},

  abstract = {The value of new archaeological knowledge is strongly determined by how credible it is, and a key measure of scientific credibility is how replicable new results are. However, few archaeologists learn the skills necessary to conduct replication as part of their training. This means there is a gap between the ideals of archaeological science and the skills we teach future researchers. Here we argue for replications as a core type of class assignment in archaeology courses to close this gap and establish a culture of replication and reproducibility. We review replication assignments in other fields and describe how to implement a replication assignment suitable for many types of archaeology programs. We describe our experience with replication in an upper-level undergraduate class on stone artifact analysis. Replication assignments can help archaeology programs give students the skills that enable transparent and reproducible research., El valor de los nuevos conocimientos arqueol\'ogicos est\'a fuertemente determinado por su credibilidad, y una medida clave de la credibilidad cient\'ifica es cu\'an replicables son los nuevos resultados. Sin embargo, pocos arque\'ologos aprenden las habilidades necesarias para llevar a cabo la replicaci\'on como parte de su entrenamiento. Esto significa que existe una brecha entre los ideales de la ciencia arqueol\'ogica y las habilidades que ense\~namos a los futuros investigadores. Aqu\'i defendemos las repeticiones como un tipo central de asignaci\'on de clase en los cursos de arqueolog\'ia para cerrar esta brecha y establecer una cultura de replicaci\'on y reproducibilidad. Revisamos las asignaciones de replicaci\'on en otros campos y describimos c\'omo implementar una asignaci\'on de replicaci\'on adecuada para muchos tipos de programas de arqueolog\'ia. Describimos nuestra experiencia con la replicaci\'on en una clase de pregrado de nivel superior en an\'alisis de artefactos de piedra. Las asignaciones de replicaci\'on pueden ayudar a los programas de arqueolog\'ia a proporcionar a los estudiantes habilidades que permiten una investigaci\'on transparente y reproducible.},

This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.},

The god who carries the name of the city of Ashur and its dominion, which steadily grew over the course of centuries, is without doubt unmistakably Assyrian and intrinsic to the Assyrian religion. The god Assur is the heart of Assyrian religion even though he likely played no prominent role in the early history of Northern Mesopotamia. The god Assur was probably not only connected to his city but also very closely associated with the steep rock projection towering over the Tigris upon which his temple was constructed. In the late 19th century BCE, the city and the temple of Assur received a completely new design, and it appears that the god Assur became associated with an entirely new theology, which was to shape the image of the god until the downfall of Ashur.},

Recent advances have improved our ability to look for and identify archaeological remains and have increased the size and complexity of our data sets. In this review we outline trends in visualization, data management, archaeological prospecting, modeling, and spatial analysis, as well as key advances in hardware and software. Due to devel-opments in education, information technology, and landscape archaeology, the implementation of spatial technology has begun to move beyond superficial applications and is no longer limited to environmental deterministic approaches. In the future, spatial technology will increasingly change archaeology in ways that will enable us to become better practitioners, scholars, and stewards.},

In California, since 2002, nearly 3,600 people have been infected with WNV with an additional 124 fatalities. Analyses of remotely- and spatially-based data have proven to facilitate the study of mosquito-borne diseases, including WNV. This study proposes an efficient procedure to identify swimming pools that may serve as potential mosquito habitat. The procedure derives the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from high resolution, multi-spectral imagery to detect the presence of surface water, and then incorporates vector-based data layers within a GIS to identify residential land parcels with detectable water. This study compared the parcels identified as having water (535) with parcels known to have swimming pools (682) resulting in an accuracy of 78.4\%. Nineteen of the 147 land parcels with swimming pools had backyards with enough vegetation to obscure the presence of a swimming pool from the satellite. The remaining 128 parcels lacked enough surface water for the NDWI to indicate them as actually having surface water. It is likely then that swimming pools, associated with such parcels, may have enough water in them to provide adequate habitat for mosquitoes, and so field inspection by mosquito abatement personnel would be justified. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Since in many areas tells are disappearing rapidly under agricultural improvement schemes or the growth of modern settlements, and since the data collected from space are constantly improving in their resolution, it makes sense to elaborate methods for what we may reasonably call ``virtual survey'': From the settlement mounds we know, we can derive mathematical descriptions within the satellite remote sensed data, and then systematically search the Earth's surface for phenomena with similar properties.},

To identify such tells and other, smaller settlement sites in the modern landscape, we develop a classifier which screens wide areas for tell-specific soil-changes, based a characteristic spectral signature in ASTER imagery. Using data from sites identified from CORONAimagery and field survey on a north Syrian plain, a Random Forest classifierwas trained, using the rawreflectances, vegetational features, correlation with prototype-spectra of the JPL ASTER SpecLib, and time flags as input features. A spatio-temporal sampling strategy allowed us to classify and fuse results from any ASTER images available for a certain region. The classifier was tested in an independent test area, centered around Tell Hamoukar, with close ground control from an archaeological survey. In this test area it was possible to identify 32 out of the 49 site bigger than 2ha. Overall we found that multi-spectral ASTER imagery can be used to provide highly specific information on character and composition of the ground, a tool which can be used in survey planning or the screening of wide regions for conservational issues or studies in landscape archaeology},

Mounding is a characteristic property of these settlement sites, resulting from millennia of continuing settlement activity at distinguished places. So far, however, this defining feature of ancient settlements has not received much attention, or even been the subject of systematic evaluation. We propose a remote sensing approach for comprehensively mapping the pattern of human settlement at large scale and establish the largest archaeological record for a landscape in Mesopotamia, mapping about 14,000 settlement sites--spanning eight millennia--at 15-m resolution in a 23,000-km(2) area in northeastern Syria. To map both low- and high-mounded places--the latter of which are often referred to as "tells"--we develop a strategy for detecting anthrosols in time series of multispectral satellite images and measure the volume of settlement sites in a digital elevation model. Using this volume as a proxy to continued occupation, we find a dependency of the long-term attractiveness of a site on local water availability, but also a strong relation to the relevance within a basin-wide exchange network that we can infer from our record and third millennium B.C. intersite routes visible on the ground until recent times. We believe it is possible to establish a nearly comprehensive map of human settlements in the fluvial plains of northern Mesopotamia and beyond, and site volume may be a key quantity to uncover long-term trends in human settlement activity from such a record.},

For each ASTER images that has been acquired in our survey area in northeastern Syria, we use a pattern classification strategy to map locations with a multispectral signal similar to the one from (few) known archaeological sites nearby. We obtain maps indicating the presence of anthrosol-soils that formed in the location of ancient settlements and that have a distinct spectral pattern under certain environmental conditions-and find that pooling the probability maps from all available time points reduces the variance of the spatial anthrosol pattern significantly. Removing biased classification maps-i.e., those that rank last when comparing the probability maps with the (limited) ground truth we have-reduces the overall prediction error even further, and we estimate optimal weights for each image using a nonnegative least squares regression strategy. The ranking and pooling strategy approach we propose in this study shows a significant improvement over the plain averaging of anthrosol probability maps that we used in an earlier attempt to map archaeological sites in a 20 000-km(2) area in northern Mesopotamia, and we expect it to work well in other surveying tasks that aim in mapping static surface patterns with limited ground truth in long series of multispectral images.},

Findings hold cross-contextual and disciplinary salience. Benefits of sharing research with the academic community included collaboration and networking, exposure and career development, contribution to knowledge, and learning and feedback. We found that sharing research with non-academic end users offered benefits in relation to end user utility, social change, securing future funding, and knowledge mobilisation. However, respondents also identified a range of notable barriers that constrained their capacity to share their research within academia and beyond. Findings can be used to support ECRs' skills and knowledge development in sharing research with diverse audiences.},

The great majority of Ashur's inhabitants mentioned in the Old Assyrian archives from Kanis participated in the long distance trade: the king and his family, the high dignitaries, the eponyms and other officials, priests and temples. In Ashur and Kanis, the possession of several slaves was considered a sign of wealth, like the possession of a house. The family formed the basic unit of Mesopotamian society and thus occupies an important place in the written documentation, especially in law codes.

PyRIS provides three main computations: (i) detection of planform centerline including complex river patterns, (ii) computation of migration vectors between subsequent centerlines, and (iii) analysis of sediment bars dynamics. PyRIS was validated against several test cases in the Amazon River basin, specifically i) main channel extraction from the anabranching Amazon river, ii) migration analysis following a large cutoff on the Ucayali River and iii) detection of sediment bar migration on the Xingu River. Tests prove the capability of PyRIS to detect the main channel in anabranching structures and chute cutoffs. PyRIS can extract extensive morphodynamic information with unprecedented automation levels and reasonable computational effort (5 h for 28 Landsat images of a 240 km reach of the Xingu River on a 3.20 GHz Intel).},

The rural land-use patterns in the southeastern region of Mallorca (Spain) were investigated in order to locate traces of the Roman field-division system. A satellite scene was analyzed using ground control for field observations to determine the rural patterns observed in the contemporary landscape and to identify the possible remains of centuriated systems. Digital image processing involved image rectification, georeferencing, and spatial enhancement using high-pass and directional filtering. While no incontrovertible evidence of centuriation was located, satellite data proved to be of use in surveying medium-scale rural patterns. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

This is reflected in many aspects of current practice, including the ultimate authority of the site director, the use of excavation methodologies that remove the act of interpretation from field archaeologists, and the general deskilling and reification of archaeological labor in fieldwork. Though there have been several examples of resistance to this hierarchical model we maintain that a sustained critique could stem from an unexpected source: the creation of communities that model anarchist principles through the implementation of the single context methodology in archaeology. In this article we explore the potential for anarchist praxis in archaeological fieldwork and the implications of anarchist thought on the issues of authority and non-alienation of labor in a neoliberal landscape.},

Ancient settlements are closely associated with abandoned courses of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. This paper discusses avulsion history, controls of avulsions, their effects on civilization evolution from 7000 to 1000 yr B.P., and interactions between human activity and channel-network evloution based on previous archaeological and geomorphological surveys, analysis of cuneiform texts, maps, satellite photos, and limited geological data. Settlement distribution in ancient Mesopotamia is modeled in relation to avulsion styles, as well as channel and sedimentation patterns. Avulsion belts are suggested as places where urban settlements emerged and were sustaained. Multiple channel networks and avulsion belts created large, naturally irrigated areas, fostering the efficient agriculture needed to sustain dense rural and urban settlements. After channel networks were abandoned during delta evolution, large-scale canal construction was required to sustain settlements but still could not prevent their decline.},

  abstract = {During April and May 2013, a total of 1057 km2 of LiDAR was flown by NCALM for a consortium of archaeologists working in West-central Belize, making this the largest surveyed area within the Mayan lowlands. Encompassing the Belize Valley and the Vaca Plateau, West-central Belize is one of the most actively researched parts of the Maya lowlands; however, until this effort, no comprehensive survey connecting all settlement had been conducted. Archaeological projects have investigated at least 18 different sites within this region. Thus, a large body of archaeological research provides both the temporal and spatial parameters for the varied ancient Maya centers that once occupied this area; importantly, these data can be used to help interpret the collected LiDAR data. The goal of the 2013 LiDAR campaign was to gain information on the distribution of ancient Maya settlement and sites on the landscape and, particularly, to determine how the landscape was used between known centers. The data that were acquired through the 2013 LiDAR campaign have significance for interpreting both the composition and limits of ancient Maya political units. This paper presents the initial results of these new data and suggests a developmental model for ancient Maya polities.},

  abstract = {Tyre's ancient northern harbour has been a source of scientific intrigue and debate for many centuries. Today an insignificant fishing harbour, looking north and sheltered from the dominant winds by a sandstone reef system, is all that remains of the famous Bronze Age, Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine anchorage havens. In light of this many scholars have long questioned whether the modern port corresponds to its counterpart in antiquity. Here, we provide litho- and biostratigraphical evidence for an ancient harbour approximately twice as large as the present, comprising the modern day harbour and city centre. Four distinct sedimentary units have been identified, translating the different Holocene palaeoenvironments: (1) The Holocene transgressive contact is dated ca. 7800 BP, and lies at the base of a silty-clay lithodependant unit. Our proxies are consistent with a low energy, lagoonal type environment, protected by an extensive reef system. (2) Transition to a coarse sand fraction after ca. 5500 BP is concomitant with the accretion of a semi-protected pocket beach. This environment served as a proto-harbour during the Middle Bronze Age (MBA). (3) After the MBA, artificial harbour sedimentation is represented by a fine-grained silty-sand unit with stress on the natural biosystem. This unit attests to a closed, marine-lagoonal type environment, which existed until around 1500 BP. Dredging activity during the Roman and Byzantine periods explains the absence of 1st millennium BC strata. (4) The economic decline of the ancient city after the Byzantine period is marked by the opening of the basin to greater marine influence, with a progradation of the harbour coastline. Natural sediment infilling diminished the size of the harbour to its present dimensions, lost until now, beneath the Medieval and Modern centres. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine researchers' motivations to publish by comparing different career stages (PhD students; temporarily employed postdocs/new professors; scholars with permanent employment) with regard to epistemic, pragmatic, and personal motives. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative analysis is mainly based on semi-structured narrative interviews with 91 researchers in the humanities, social, and natural sciences, based at six renowned (anonymous) universities in Germany, the UK, and the USA. These narratives contain answers to the direct question ``why do you publish?'' as well as remarks on motivations to publish in relation to other questions and themes. The interdisciplinary interpretation is based on both sociological science studies and philosophy of science in practice. Findings At each career stage, epistemic, pragmatic, and personal motivations to publish are weighed differently. Confirming earlier studies, the authors find that PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in temporary positions mainly feel pressured to publish for career-related reasons. However, across status groups, researchers also want to publish in order to support collective knowledge generation. Research limitations/implications The sample of interviewees may be biased toward those interested in reflecting on their day-to-day work. Social implications Continuous and collective reflection is imperative for preventing uncritical internalization of pragmatic reasons to publish. Creating occasions for reflection is a task not only of researchers themselves, but also of administrators, funders, and other stakeholders. Originality/value Most studies have illuminated how researchers publish while adapting to or growing into the contemporary publish-or-perish culture. This paper addresses the rarely asked question why researchers publish at all.},

In situ observations are used in cultural heritage and archaeological sites mapping. However, this procedure requires periodic observations, which are practically difficult to combine with traditional methods and practices since this is time consuming and expensive. Thus, modern technologies, mainly GIS and remote sensing, are gaining attention as tools for prediction at archaeological sites. The aim of this paper is to assess the application of GIS and remote sensing in order to develop a predictive model, which will be used in locating areas with high potential as archaeological sites in the Awsard area (southern Morocco). The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a multi-criteria decision making method, which integrates archaeological data and environmental factors, geospatial analysis and predictive modelling, has been applied to the identification of possible tumuli locations in the study area. The model was developed using a zone of 21 km2 with 233 known sites. It was later validated using 530 unknown sites within an area of 980 km2. The acceptable accuracy of 93\% was calculated using an estimation of predictive gain, which proves the efficiency of the model's predictive ability.},

Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of "good practice" recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the "reference classification" will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We test multiple methods of removing vegetation artefacts and investigate the use of regionalization. Our final 'Bare-Earth' SRTM product shows global improvements greater than 10 m in the bias over the original SRTM DEM in vegetated areas compared with ground elevations determined from ICESat data with a significant reduction in the root mean square error from over 14 m to 6 m globally.

The text focuses on satellites-including power, data storage, and telemetry systems-because this knowledge is important for the development of new remote sensing systems. A new chapter dedicated to LiDAR develops the necessary physics for each domain and presents a few appropriate operational systems. A radiometry component has been added to the infrared (IR), radar (SAR), and LiDAR sections. Full-color images, as well as detailed examples and problems sets, make this a valuable textbook for students and engineers alike. Preface -- 1. Introduction to remote sensing -- 2.

  abstract = {This article investigates the making of Assyrian landscapes during the late second and early first millennia B.C.E. From the late 14th century B.C.E. onward, the Assyrians des- ignated the emergent core of their territorial state as the ``Land of A\v{s}\v{s}ur'' in their royal inscriptions. However, over the course of the next several centuries, the cultural geogra- phy of the Land of A\v{s}\v{s}ur was continuously redefined while gradually shifting northward from the arid environs of the city A\v{s}\v{s}ur to the well-watered and resourceful landscapes around the confluence of the Tigris and the Upper and Lower Zab Rivers. Contempora- neously, the landscapes of the Upper Tigris basin (southeastern Turkey) and the Jazira witnessed extensive settlement and cultivation as Assyrian provinces and frontiers. Drawing on archaeological survey evidence and a critical reading of the textual ac- counts of urban foundations, this paper argues that such mobility of Assyrian landscapes was part and parcel of broader processes of environmental and settlement change in Up- per Mesopotamia. Assyrian annalistic texts point to an elaborate rhetoric of landscape that portrays state interventions in the form of city foundations and building programs, construction of irrigation canals, planting of orchards, opening of new quarries, and settlement of populations. Furthermore, the making of commemorative monuments such as rock reliefs and stelae allowed the Assyrian state to inscribe symbolically charged places in foreign landscapes and incorporate them into the narratives of the empire. By drawing attention to the long-term trends of settlement in Upper Mesopotamia during the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages and the agency of landscapes, the article contextu- alizes the Assyrian political rhetoric of development at the time of a highly fluid world of geographical imagination.},

  abstract = {This paper illustrates the potential of machine learning-based classification of multisensor, multitemporal satellite data for the remote detection and mapping of archaeological mounded settlements in arid environments. Our research integrates multitemporal synthetic-aperture radar and multispectral bands to produce a highly accurate probability field of mound signatures. The results largely expand the known concentration of Indus settlements in the Cholistan Desert in Pakistan (ca. 3300 to 1500 BC), with the detection of hundreds of new sites deeper in the desert than previously suspected including several large-sized (\&gt;30 ha) urban centers. These distribution patterns have major implications regarding the influence of climate change and desertification in the collapse of the largest of the Old-World Bronze Age civilizations.This paper presents an innovative multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach using remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Cholistan (Pakistan). The Cholistan Desert presents one of the largest concentrations of Indus Civilization sites (from ca. 3300 to 1500 BC). Cholistan has figured prominently in theories about changes in water availability, the rise and decline of the Indus Civilization, and the transformation of fertile monsoonal alluvial plains into an extremely arid margin. This paper implements a multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach for the remote detection of archaeological mounds. A classifier algorithm that employs a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multispectral images has been implemented in Google Earth Engine, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures across an area that covers ca. 36,000 km2. The results show that the area presents many more archaeological mounds than previously recorded, extending south and east into the desert, which has major implications for understanding the archaeological significance of the region. The detection of small (\&lt;5 ha) to large mounds (\&gt;30 ha) suggests that there were continuous shifts in settlement location. These shifts are likely to reflect responses to a dynamic and changing hydrological network and the influence of the progressive northward advance of the desert in a long-term process that culminated in the abandonment of much of the settled area during the Late Harappan period.},

  abstract = {Morphological analysis of landforms has traditionally relied on the interpretation of imagery. Although imagery provides a natural view of an area of interest (AOI) images are largely hindered by the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, the quality of the image and, mainly, the lack of topographical information, which is an essential factor for a correct understanding of the AOI's geomorphology. More recently digital surface models (DSMs) have been incorporated into the analytical toolbox of geomorphologists. These are usually high-resolution models derived from digital photogrammetric processes or LiDAR data. However, these are restricted to relatively small areas and are expensive or complex to acquire, which limits widespread implementation. In this paper, we present the multi-scale relief model (MSRM), which is a new algorithm for the visual interpretation of landforms using DSMs. The significance of this new method lies in its capacity to extract landform morphology from both high- and low-resolution DSMs independently of the shape or scale of the landform under study. This method thus provides important advantages compared to previous approaches as it: (1) allows the use of worldwide medium resolution models, such as SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X; (2) offers an alternative to traditional photograph interpretation that does not rely on the quality of the imagery employed nor on the environmental conditions and time of its acquisition; and (3) can be easily implemented for large areas using traditional GIS/RS software. The algorithm is tested in the Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve, which is a very large low-relief alluvial plain in northwest India where 10 000 km of palaeoriver channels have been mapped using MSRM. The code, written in Google Earth Engine's implementation of JavaScript, is provided as Supporting Information for its use in any other AOI without particular technical knowledge or access to topographical data.},

This is especially important for understanding the role of cities in the history of human civilization and for determining whether studies of ancient cities are relevant for contemporary science and policy. As a step in this direction, we develop a theory of settlement scaling in archaeology, deriving the relationship between population and settled area from a consideration of the interplay between social and infrastructural networks. We then test these models on settlement data from the Pre-Hispanic Basin of Mexico to show that this ancient settlement system displays spatial scaling properties analogous to those observed in modern cities. Our data derive from over 1,500 settlements occupied over two millennia and spanning four major cultural periods characterized by different levels of agricultural productivity, political centralization and market development. We show that, in agreement with theory, total settlement area increases with population size, on average, according to a scale invariant relation with an exponent in the range [Formula: see text]. As a consequence, we are able to infer aggregate socio-economic properties of ancient societies from archaeological measures of settlement organization. Our findings, from an urban settlement system that evolved independently from its old-world counterparts, suggest that principles of settlement organization are very general and may apply to the entire range of human history.},

We examine the extent to which increasing returns are apparent in archaeological settlement data from the pre-Hispanic Basin of Mexico. We review previous work on the quantitative relationship between population size and average settled area in this society and then present a general analysis of their patterns of monument construction and house sizes. Estimated scaling parameter values and residual statistics support the hypothesis that increasing returns to scale characterized various forms of socioeconomic production available in the archaeological record and are found to be consistent with key expectations from settlement scaling theory. As a consequence, these results provide evidence that the essential processes that lead to increasing returns in contemporary cities may have characterized human settlements throughout history, and demonstrate that increasing returns do not require modern forms of political or economic organization.},

Yet the two topics are rarely explicitly theorized in a sustained integrated investigation within a single study, despite the fact that monumental architecture is often considered a primary basis for identifying the presence of urban planning. This article makes the related methodological arguments that both phenomena benefit from a more full consideration of one another, and that the meaningful aspect of monumentality and urban symbology needs to be considered in conjunction with the formal aspect of monuments and urban layouts. These positions are then implemented in a study of the Syro-Anatolian city-state system that existed in the ancient Near East during the early first millennium bc. The capital cities of these polities were characterized by a program of monumentality that brought royalty, city walls, gates and monumental sculpture into an unmistakable constellation of associations. The consistency of this pattern of monumentality and urban form suggests that at least a degree of urban planning existed.},

Plaza size scales with population in a sublinear relationship in all three groups, meaning that larger settlements had considerably less plaza area per capita than smaller settlements.

This study focused on two important open research questions: (i) Which NDWI model produces the most superior results? and (ii) How much does accuracy change in the use of 15 m and 30 m spatial resolution satellite data? For the accuracy analysis, area values extracted from the NDWI models were compared with in-situ lake area values as measured by the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI). The results of this study show that as the lake area grows, discrimination of water from other classes is better with NIR region, and that the performance of NDWI(Green, NIR) is relatively better in terms of lake expansion effect. Results also indicate that hydrometeorological factors such as precipitation and evaporation and anthropogenic factors such as irrigation and daily consumption are decisive in lake area variations. The order of accuracy from high to low was found to be NDWI(Green, NIR), NDWI(Green, SWIR1) and NDWI(Green, SWIR2), and 15 m spatial resolution data generated better results than 30 m resolution.},

  abstract = {Simulations of spatial interaction in archaeology have been successful in predicting the emergence of central sites, and political and economic hierarchies that match observed long-term settlement patterns. It still remains unclear, however, to what degree such models can effectively allow for uncertainty in the archaeological record, especially when it comes to incomplete and unevenly distributed settlement data, and how best they might incorporate artefact-scale evidence. This paper aims to address these issues, while attempting to tackle widely debated aspects of socio-political organisation and cultural interaction in the prehistoric Cretan landscape at the period immediately before and after the foundation of the first palace of Phaistos, one of the less well documented Bronze Age phases. We employ a simulation of spatial interaction inspired by approaches first developed in urban geography and combine this with regression-based predictive modelling to address the uncertainty introduced by missing settlements. We use evidence from artefact analysis partly to calibrate and partly to validate our model. We conclude that such an approach can contribute to more convincing archaeological theories about socio-political organisation, cultural affinity and regional identity by providing new evidence even in the presence of very fragmented data.},

More recently, there has been a notable convergence both in analytical scope and in the form of software implementations; this has not been paralleled, however, by comparable efforts in terms of explicitly comparative or even integrative studies, a gap we seek to (begin to) address in the present paper on the basis of parallel analyses of topological, visual and metric properties for two case studies. The purpose of this exercise is threefold: Firstly, comparisons of the respective analytical results will aid an appreciation of the strengths and potential weaknesses of specific approaches as well as an identification of both complementary and alternative techniques, but will ultimately also help to gain a reliable basis for future integrative work. Secondly, and more specifically, GIS-based metric integration analysis will be introduced and `fieldtested' in comparison with conventional space syntax analyses, from which it derives \textendash{} in a first step towards a more integrated perspective \textendash{} part of its inspiration. Thirdly and no less importantly, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of the archaeological contexts under discussion, i.e. the Middle Bronze Age Building A of Quartier Mu at Malia on Crete and the Late Bronze Age palace of Pylos at Ano Englianos in Messenia.},

  abstract = {This paper highlights a spatial interaction entropy maximization (SIEM) model to reproduce and understand past human settlement hierarchy in Central Anatolia (CA) and the Khabur Triangle (KT) during the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1600. BC). We propose applying SIEM to understand which sites and areas would have become prominent in this period by using known archaeological sites as point data and textual evidence for calibration purposes. The model addresses to which extent general factors such as topography, transportation, or social-ecological advantages (e.g., environmental benefits, external contacts, religion) make locations attractive for trade and settlement and why some archaeological sites become more prominent than others in the period discussed. The modelling results have been checked against the observed data from archaeological survey carried out in the KT and CA in order to explain the best fits. The results show that geography and topography can explain the growth of some main urban centres. In other cases, settlement hierarchies are generally explained by different initial advantages (endogenous or exogenous) for each site. Similar patterns are evident in CA and the KT, where movement constraint is due to political landscapes fragmented into numerous competing polities. In the KT, movement is slightly more restricted than CA, suggesting that warfare intensity is higher in open plains than in hilly and mountainous landscapes. Furthermore, SIEM is demonstrated to be useful in characterizing areas of interactions on different spatial scales in CA and the KT. Overall, the results demonstrate the advantage of SIEM model to enable researchers to account for missing empirical data, to compare settlement and interaction dynamics in different regions and to explain which underlying factors are beyond the reproducible observed patterns.},

Nevertheless, these three archaeological proxies have rarely been compared. This paper therefore explores the strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of archaeological evidence for population patterns, as well as how they address related issues such as taphonomic loss, chronological uncertainty and uneven sampling. Our overall substantive goal is to reconstruct demographic fluctuations in central Italy from the Late Mesolithic to the fall of the Roman Empire (7500 BC-AD 500), and with this in mind, we bring to bear an unusually detailed and extensive dataset of published central Italian archaeological surveys, consisting of some 10,971 occupation phases at 7383 different sites. The comparative results demonstrate reassuring consistency in the suggested demographic patterns, and where such patterns diverge across different proxies (e.g. Late Bronze Age/Iron Age) they often do so in useful ways that suggest changes in population structure such as site nucleation or dispersal.},

Human impact on the landscape has been assessed by the analysis of pollen indicator groups.

Archaeologists must be particularly careful when applying rank-size analysis to a given study area as the results can change at a different spatial scale. With these premises in mind, in this work, I first show the results produced by performing rank-size analyses on the two whole study areas and assess comparatively any difference in the observed patterns between them. Second, I break down each study area into smaller window analyses in order to detect how settlement size distributions change at a more local scale. The results show that at a larger regional scale, both central Anatolia and the Khabur Triangle in the Middle Bronze Age are characterized by fragmented politically landscapes of competing independent polities loosely integrated. By contrast, at smaller local scales central Anatolia and the Khabur Triangle show a different picture. In central Anatolia settlement systems appear more nucleated in large centres dominating their surrounding rural hinterlands and strong political and economic centralization is evident at K\"ultepe and Bo\u{g}azk\"oy. On the other hand, in the Khabur Triangle settlement primacy is less accentuated and the polities are more loosely integrated. These examples demonstrate the advantage of using rank size analysis at different spatial scales for having a complete understanding of the dynamics behind the observed empirical data.},

With the term ``first order of effects'' I mean that the observations throughout a study area ``vary from place to place due to the changes in the underlying properties of the local environment'' (O'Sullivan and Unwin, 2003, 79). The second order of effects, instead, is due to the local interaction between the observations. Therefore, I am going to investigate through this particular method how the environmental variables (first order of effects) and the direct interaction between the settlements themselves (second order of effects) can determine different spatial patterns (cluster, even or random distribution of settlements).},

There are two general approaches regarding the application of these techniques in underwater archaeology; they are being increasingly used to identify, locate and map (i) ancient and historical shipwrecks lying on the seafloor or partly buried in it and (ii) the coastal palaeogeogra-phy and thus submerged sites of archaeological interest (submerged ancient cities, settlements, ports and man-made structures). The underwater remote sensing techniques most commonly applied to underwater archaeology employ: (i) single and multi-beam echosounders (ii) side scan sonar (acousting imaging), (iii) laser line scan (optical imaging) (iv) subbottom profiler, (v) marine magne-tometer and (vi) undersea vehicles. The objectives of this paper are twofold: (i) to present the results of remote sensing surveys that carried out at sites of archaeological and historical interest, in Greece (Dokos Island, ancient harbour of Kyllene and Navarino Bay whereas a historical naval Battle took place) and in Eastern Mediterranean Sea (Alexandria Egypt and Mazotos shipwreck Cyprus), and (ii) to prove the applicability of remote sensing techniques in underwater archaeology showing that a combination of these can be a very effective tool.},

  abstract = {Theories of scientific and technological change view discovery and invention as endogenous processes1,2, wherein previous accumulated knowledge enables future progress by allowing researchers to, in Newton's words, `stand on the shoulders of giants'3\textendash 7. Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45\,million papers and 3.9\,million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric\textemdash the CD index12\textemdash that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13\textendash 17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the `shoulders of giants' view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.},

  abstract = {It is clear from the royal correspondence of the Assyrian empire and from the annals of Assyrian kings that the construction of forts was an integral part of the permanent establishment of Assyrian sovereignty in newly conquered regions. Forts served as garrison outposts in formerly hostile areas and were therefore the first footholds of Assyrian expansion into recently annexed territories. They were military centres, from which campaigns and intelligence operations were conducted into and beyond the frontier, administrative centres where the daily affairs of the surrounding areas were directed and monitored, and communications hubs through which news and information were channelled. In addition to these roles, forts or garrison centres also served as conduits through which the Assyrian ideology of imperialism could be diffused into the periphery of the empire and the process of the acculturation of the ``foreign'' inhabitants of peripheral zones could be conducted.},

  abstract = {One of the most enduring problems for the study of ancient empires is the fact that material correlates indicative of imperial integration are often difficult to define in the archaeological record. This situation results in part from two factors that distinguish empires from other less complex political formations. First, the military and administrative structures that integrate otherwise diverse areas into a single imperial system vary considerably in their nature and intensity, and second, such systems are often superimposed over existing political,economic, and social structures, thus altering existing systems in ways which may or may not be visible in the archaeological record. Thus the archaeological manifestations of empire may be far more diverse than those of less complex polities. This article explores how the material correlates of Assyrian imperialism are manifest in the archaeological record by analyzing and combining archaeological and textual data from the Mesopotamian Iron Age (ca. 1100-600 B.C.) in southeastern Anatolia.It suggests that imperial integration affects the archaeological record in significant and identifiable ways by illuminating three overarching themes that are characteristic of Assyrian imperialism: the establishment of agricultural colonies in newly annexed regions; the use or enforcement of buffer zones between frontier provinces and hostile neighbors; and the discontiguous nature of Assyrian imperial control.

Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions, statistical extrapolation of regional data and satellite imagery, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal. Losses in Australia and the USA linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

One of the key advances to emerge is a significant shift from the pre-existing agro-pastoral tell-based communities of the Bronze Age and earlier periods towards a lengthy phase of settlement dispersal starting perhaps as early as the Iron Age. Other major advances are clearly evident in the Halaf, Late Chalcolithic-Uruk, Late Early Bronze and Middle Bronze Ages.},

This paper advocates the value and importance of a hitherto under-utilised historical mapping resource\textemdash the Survey of India 1'' to 1-mile map series, which was based on surveys started in the mid\textendash late nineteenth century, and published progressively from the early twentieth century AD. These maps present a systematic documentation of the topography of the British dominions in the South Asian Subcontinent. Incidentally, they also documented the locations, the height and area of thousands of elevated mounds that were visible in the landscape at the time that the surveys were carried out, but have typically since been either damaged or destroyed by the expansion of irrigation agriculture and urbanism. Subsequent reanalysis has revealed that many of these mounds were actually the remains of ancient settlements. The digitisation and analysis of these historic maps thus creates a unique opportunity for gaining insight into the landscape archaeology of South Asia. This paper reviews the context within which these historical maps were created, presents a method for georeferencing them, and reviews the symbology that was used to represent elevated mound features that have the potential to be archaeological sites. This paper should be read in conjunction with the paper by Arnau Garcia et al. in the same issue of Geosciences, which implements a research programme combining historical maps and a range of remote sensing approaches to reconstruct historical landscape dynamics in the Indus River Basin.},

Here the authors reveal a similar process in the hills of Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where early farming villages overlook the plains of the Punjab and Sindh, heartland of the later Indus civilisation. Today this is a troubled border zone, with difficult access on the ground, but our researchers make exemplary use of satellite survey to map the villages in their specific local environments.},

This paper aims to review evidence from a series of archaeological surveys to illustrate trends in settlement during the 4th and 3rd millennium BC. Re-analysis of survey data from three exemplar regions in the Middle Euphrates demonstrates that by including settlement away from the main Euphrates Valley we get a picture of two main zones of settlement corresponding to agro-ecological zones. In the northern zone, settlements underwent phases of nucleation and dispersal through time, but long-term configurations were relatively stable. In contrast, a southern zone, south of the Sajur Valley, was characterized by rapid colonization and some degree of boom and bust growth of towns, perhaps encouraged by the opportunities afforded by the high risk but high rewards of the `zone of uncertainty'. Although ecological conditions and climate change played a role in settlement growth and failure, in part by setting the parameters for agro-pastoral production, it is evident that socio-political circumstances, chronic conflict and sheer opportunism were probably key to both the growth and decline of the southern settlements.},

The gate proved to be one of Nineveh's larger defensive gates and a scene of chaos and destruction. Tower 4 to the south of the gate was of irregular masonry, having been hastily rebuilt. The juxtaposition of a rough tower directly beside the fine ashlar masonry of the rest of the curtain wall of the gate appears to reflect a political instability that prevailed during the declining years of Assyrian rule. The late reconstruction of Tower 4 contrasts with the earlier attention to detail seen in building work of Sennacherib's reign (704\textendash 681 BC), when smoothly dressed orthostats lined the lower walls of the gate's large inner court and sophisticated waterproof membranes of bitumen-soaked reeds protected the mud-brick superstructures. Buried beneath the pavement in the corners of the court were apotropaic foundation figurines. Within the only partially excavated outer entrance passage at least twelve individuals died, perhaps while defending the city or trying to escape from it, as a stallion and a rider lay at the eastern limit of the gate passage. Within the reduced width of the gate passage were eight adult males, four adolescents and four children including one infant. Weaponry was found throughout the area and the scattered bodies lay where they had fallen. The associated small finds, which had not been looted, included silver jewelry, bronze personal items, stamp seals and a composite necklace.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing allowed monitoring the reservoir water level by estimating its surface extension. Surface extension has been estimated using different approaches, employing both optical (Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-Off, Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS and ASTER images) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (Cosmo SkyMed and TerraSAR-X). Images were characterized by different acquisition modes, geometric and spectral resolutions, allowing the evaluation of alternative and/or complementary techniques. For each kind of image, two techniques have been tested: The first based on an unsupervised classification and suitable to automate the process, the second based on visual matching with contour lines with the aim of fully exploiting the dataset. Their performances were evaluated by comparison with water levels measured in situ (r2 = 0.97 using the unsupervised classification, r2 = 0.95 using visual matching) demonstrating that both techniques are suitable to quantify reservoir surface extension. However \textasciitilde 90\% of available images were analyzed using the visual matching method, and just 37 images out of 58 using the other method. The evaluation of the water level from the water surface, using both techniques, could be easily extended to un-gauged reservoirs to manage the variations of the levels during normal operation. In addition, during the period of investigation, the use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) allowed the estimation of dam displacements. The advantage of using as reference a GNSS permanent station positioned relatively far from the dam, allowed the exclusion of any interaction with the site deformations. By comparing results from both techniques, relationships between the orthogonal displacement component via GNSS, estimated water levels via remote sensing and in situ measurements were investigated. During periods of changing water level (April 2011\textendash September 2011 and October 2011\textendash March 2012), the moving average of displacement time series (middle section on the dam crest) shows a range of variability of 2 mm. The dam deformation versus reservoir water level behavior differs during the reservoir emptying and filling periods indicating a hysteresis-kind loop.},

The aim of this study was to discover material remains of the Macedonian military camp on the Navkur Plain in Kurdish Iraq. For this purpose, three very high resolution satellite (VHRS) datasets from Pleiades and WorldView-2 were acquired and subjected to multi-variant image processing (development of different color composites, integration of multispectral and panchromatic images, use of principle component analysis transformation, use of vegetation indices). Documentation of photointerpretation was carried out through the vectorization of features/areas. Due to the character of the sought-after artifacts (remnants of a large enclosure), features were categorized into two types: linear features and areal features. As a result, 19 linear features and 2 areal features were found in the study area of the Mahad hills. However, only a few features fulfilled the expected geometric criteria (layout and size) and were subjected to field groundtruthing, which ended in negative results. It is concluded that no traces have been found that could be interpreted as remnants of an earthen enclosure capable of accommodating around 47,000 soldiers. Further research perspectives are also suggested.},

In "The Uruk World System," Guillermo Algaze concentrates on the unprecedented and wide-ranging process of external expansion that coincided with the rapid initial crystallization of Mesopotamian civilization. In this extensive study, he contends that the rise of early Sumerian polities cannot be understood without also taking into account the developments in surrounding peripheral areas. This new edition includes a substantial new chapter that explores recent data and interpretations of the expansion of Uruk settlements across Syro-Mesopotamia. Book Description Archaeologists and historians have long been keenly interested in the emergence of early cities and states in the ancient Near East, particularly in the growth of early Sumerian civilization in the lowlands of Mesopotamia during the second half of the fourth millennium B.C. Most scholars have focused on the internal transformations attending this process, such as the development of new forms of spatial organization, socio-political relationships, and economic arrangements. In The Uruk World System, Guillermo Algaze concentrates instead on the unprecedented and wide-ranging process of external expansion that coincided with the rapid initial crystallization of Mesopotamian civilization. He contends that the rise of early Sumerian polities cannot be understood without also taking into account developments in surrounding peripheral areas. Algaze reviews an extensive body of archaeological evidence for cross-cultural exchange between the nascent city-states in the Mesopotamian lowlands and communities in immediately surrounding areas. He shows that at their very inception the more highly integrated lowland centers succeeded in establishing a variety of isolated, far-flung outposts in areas at the periphery of the Mesopotamian lowlands. Embedded in an alien hinterland characterized by demonstrably less complex societies, the outposts were commonly established at the apex of preexisting regional settlement hierarchies and invariably at focal nodes astride important trade routes. Algaze argues that these early colonial out-posts served as collection points for coveted peripheral resources acquired in exchange for core manufactures and that they reflect an inherently asymmetrical system of economic hegemony that extended far beyond areas under the direct political control of Sumerian polities in southern Mesopotamia. From this he concludes that economic exploitation of less developed peripheral areas was integral to the earliest development of civilization in the ancient Near East.},

We would also like to take the opportunity of apologizing to those expeditions whose results we have been unable to include for lack of time or because of difficulty in communication: the chief casualty is the important work at Basra, now under the direction of Dr. Abd-as-Sittar al-'Azzawi, Director-General for the South of Iraq, and the reports on a number of other sites are less detailed than we would have wished.},

Geographical expeditions were extremely important for filling out the contents of both Russian and Soviet state topographic maps. Cartography had been centralized in many ways in Russian times, but the centralization became absolute under the Soviet system. At the same time cartography came under centralized control of the government in the State Cartographic Service, and the publication and use of large-scale maps were subject to governmental restrictions. The 1:100,000 map of the USSR was compiled in 1954, and was not designed to provide ordinary consumers with topographic information. Any maps for ordinary users, their scales notwithstanding, were based on the 1:2,500,000 map of the country. In the 1970s, the map was deliberately impaired by a cartographic projection that resulted in random distortions of the map's contents.},

The present paper discusses the piece, suggesting that it shows affinities to Neo-Assyrian art. The wider implications of this attribution for our perception of Tayma in the Neo-Assyrian period are briefly sketched.},

  abstract = {Water is one of the most common and important objects on the earth, and its extraction is of great significance to many related researches in remote sensing domain. However, water always appears diversely, which makes its extraction not so simple. Many former methods are developed to extract water, which mainly based on a single model and only use spectral information, but the results are not so satisfying. An adaptive extraction method based on normalized difference water index (NDWI) is proposed here to extract water completely and accurately from remote sensing image. This study first compute NDWI to enhance water's spectral information, and then it is redefined so as to use the modified histogram auto-segmentation method to initially separate water from background; next, after segmentation, water pixels can be searched out and are taken as seed points to proceed region growing to get the local area of water; last, the edge of the local area is searched by a window template, and iterative classification within it is employed to precisely extract water's precise partition. Experiments are carried out here on an ETM+ image of a paralic area to extract water. Through comparison with other commonly used methods, it shows that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the others. \textcopyright{} 2011 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

It sketches a number of individuals who lived within the Neo-Assyrian empire in order to highlight specific social and economic circumstances as well as certain aspects of daily life. The high degree of social, cultural, and economic homogeneity that characterizes the Neo-Assyrian period, despite the great climatic and geographical differences of the region, was the result of the deportations and became the most lasting legacy of the Assyrian empire. The chapter emphasizes that relocating the administrative and political center to a new city, in conjunction with the influx of new population groups, resulted in a weakening of the influence of the former urban elites over the king. The fate of the cousins \v{S}umaya and Urdu-Gula illustrates this point.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility is the hallmark of good science. Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow. Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates and analyses the puzzle concerning the constant hostility between Syria and Iraq. Empirical and experimental examinations show that while pan-Arabism played a secondary role in the conflict between Syria and Iraq, the geopolitical realities of the two countries, and resemblance of the belief systems of the two presidents \d{H}\=afe\d{z} al-Asad and \d{S}add\=am \d{H}usayn played a determining role in Syro-Iraqi hostile relations. The rivalry between Syria and Iraq was driven by power consolidation and regional leadership, but also in an ideological sense by a romanticised conception of pan-Arabism. When the Ba\lasp th party came to power in both countries, the two regimes became almost identical ideologically (Sluglett, 2000). As a result, they ended up competing over the same tools of regime legitimacy (Eppel, 1999). Therefore, although pan-Arabism has always played a role in Syro-Iraqi tension, its role during this period was secondary. The geopolitical position of Syria and Iraq determined their foreign policy role. The Persian Gulf was the Iraqi regime's area of influence, while Lebanon was Syria's area of influence because of its lack of strategic depth. As a result, geopolitics stretched the two regimes in two opposite directions (Ehteshami, 2015). Thus, the Iraqi regime adopted a dogmatic approach in the Arab-Israel conflict, whereas the Syrian regime took a pragmatic approach in this conflict because of its geographical proximity to Israel. The two main subjects of geopolitics, the Kirkuk-Banias pipeline, and the water of the Euphrates, also played a significant role in feeding the tension between the two countries. When Presidents \d{H}\=afe\d{z} al-Asad and \d{S}add\=am \d{H}usayn \textendash{} both powerful personalities - came to power (1970 and 1979 respectively), they added a personal element to the dynamics of hostile Syro-Iraqi relations. This thesis argues that because the two presidents dominated the process of decision making in their countries, their belief systems played a determining role in shaping Syro-Iraqi hostility. The experimental research demonstrates that the two presidents had similar belief systems \textendash{} represented by dogmatism and mistrust of others, risk-taking, and adopting passive cooperation as a strategy in their foreign policy behaviour \textendash{} which made reconciliation between Syria and Iraq exceedingly unlikely during the period they were in power (1979-2000).},

Published work in both anarchic archaeology and anthropology has tended to make little use of the large and challenging body of literature created by members of anarchist political and philosophical movements over the last 180 years. This paper explores a sample of themes from anarchist literature that intersect with the interests of archaeologists. It is argued that ideas such as the anarchist use of surrealism, the anarchist take on environmentalism and radical anarchist history might all provide useful inspiration to archaeologists. It is clear however that the nature of the alternative philosophies utilized by anarchists will not make incorporating the work into archaeology a straightforward task, and archaeologists themselves are not exempt from the critical analysis of anarchists.},

This paper explores the development of the EAMENA methodology, and discusses some of the problems of working across such a broad region. We discuss two main case studies: the World Heritage site of Cyrene illustrates how the project can use satellite imagery (dating from the 1960s to 2017), in conjunction with published data to create a detailed set of database records for a single site and, in particular, highlights the impact of modern urban expansion across the region. Conversely, the Homs Cairns case study demonstrates how the EAMENA methodology also works at an extensive scale, and integrates image interpretation (using imagery dating from the 1960s to 2016), landuse mapping and field survey (2007\textendash 2010) to record and analyse the condition of hundreds of features across a small study region. This study emphasises the impact of modern agricultural and land clearing activities. Ultimately, this paper assesses the effectiveness of the EAMENA approach, evaluating its potential success against projects using crowd-sourcing and automation for recording archaeological sites, and seeks to determine the most appropriate methods to use to document sites and assess disturbances and threats across such a vast and diverse area.},

We apply this and perform validation at two case studies, the Aswan and Kom-Ombo area in Egypt, and the Jufra oases in Libya, with an overall accuracy of the results ranging from 85\textendash 91\%. Human activities, such as construction, agriculture, rubbish dumping and natural processes were successfully detected at archaeological sites by the algorithm, allowing these sites to be prioritised for recording. A few instances of change too small to be detected by Sentinel-2 were missed, and false positives were caused by registration errors, shadow and movements of sand. This paper shows that the expansion of agricultural and urban areas particularly threatens the survival of archaeological sites, but our extensive online database of archaeological sites and programme of training courses places us in a unique position to make our methods widely available.},

However, few attempts have been made to discover just how closely one can predict from detailed knowledge of surface distributions what he will find if he digs.In October and November, 1968, surface collections based on statistical sampling techniques were made at two mounds in Diyarbakir Vilayet, Turkey. The tabulated data were put into the form of contour maps. We find that study of these maps, singly or in combination as overlays, suggests numerous hypotheses that can be formulated much more precisely than those deriving from the usual intuitive method based on simple inspection of the site surface. Soundings were made to test some of the major hypotheses. The results of the soundings plus subsequent statistical analyses suggest that intensive, systematic surface collection is an extremely useful technique for determining where to dig. It is also highly productive of testable hypotheses relevant to the total interpretation of the site.},

In this article, we review the current state of archaeological video games, including mainstream and educational games. While this is not an exhaustive discussion, it provides an introduction and overview to the current landscape. We propose that an understanding of current popular archaeological video games is important to archaeologists for three reasons: (1) it is a source of potentially dangerous misconceptions about the discipline that must be addressed; (2) it can be a source of inspiration for funding and a means to recruit new students to the discipline; and (3) games can be leveraged as teaching moments in classrooms and public discussions. It is important that archaeologists recognize the ways the discipline is being portrayed in such public contexts, in order to maximize the potential benefit for archaeology and to prevent further misconceptions about the subject.},

We need a new set of tools to use that are the equivalent of the pick, spade, trowel, and brush, but for a space populated by pixels and sprites. Classic, real-world requirements as elementary as measuring become complex within the gaming space. Taking levels, recording GPS points, and even photography operate differently in this new dimension. As archaeologists operating in the virtual world, we not only need to define the questions that need answering but we also need to create a methodology for ``excavation'' that can be shared across platforms and games of all varieties. This article attempts to articulate the first unified methodology for actual archaeological survey/excavation conducted within video games, defining the tools needed and a new kind of mathematics to understand and explain virtual topography and topology.},

This article describes my underlying theory of software stratigraphy and explains how (and why) the Harris matrix is appropriate for documenting software development in a visual way. The article includes my complete data set as well as screen captures, plus overall and detail photos of my hand-drawn software matrix prototype, followed by a bullet-pointed how-to guide for others to use when documenting the history of any computer program.

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging is a growing area in remote sensing in which an imaging spectrometer collects hundreds of images (at different wavelength channels) for the same area on the surface of the Earth. Hyperspectral images are extremely high-dimensional, and require on-board processing algorithms able to satisfy near real-time constraints in applications such as wildland fire monitoring, mapping of oil spills and chemical contamination, etc. One of the most widely used techniques for analyzing hyperspectral images is spectral unmixing, which allows for sub-pixel data characterization. This is particularly important since the available spatial resolution in hyperspectral images is typically of several meters, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that several spectrally pure substances (called endmembers in hyperspectral imaging terminology) can be found within each imaged pixel. There have been several efforts towards the efficient implementation of hyperspectral unmixing algorithms on architectures susceptible of being mounted onboard imaging instruments, including field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). While FPGAs are generally difficult to program, GPUs are difficult to adapt to onboard processing requirements in spaceborne missions due to its extremely high power consumption. In turn, with the increase in the number of cores, multi-core platforms have recently emerged as an easier to program platform compared to FPGAs, and also more tolerable radiation and power consumption requirements. However, a detailed assessment of the performance versus energy consumption of these architectures has not been conducted as of yet in the field of hyperspectral imaging, in which it is particularly important to achieve processing results in real-time. In this article, we provide a thoughtful perspective on this relevant issue and further analyze the performance versus energy consumption ratio of different processing chains for spectral unmixing when implemented on multi-core platforms.},

A number of these have been inventoried and mapped during the last century using ground surveys. Because of the size of the region and problems with accessibility, remote sensing and GIS mapping techniques have proven invaluable in our recent studies of this area. Specifically, we studied the area around the ancient site of Nippur and Lake Dalmaj, making use of a variety of sensor systems including Landsat, SPOT, Radarsat, ASTER, and Corona. A variety of enhancement and classification techniques were applied to these different image types to better understand patterns and distributions on the land, as well as the capabilities of different sensor systems. To aid in this investigation extensive GIS databases were created from a variety of field studies such as Robert Adams's work, the Heartland of Cities. These databases were used in conjunction with the imagery to isolate different age groupings of sites and canals and map their location and extent; areas potentially containing new sites were also identified. This study illustrates how distinctive this area is in terms of mounds and layers of canals as compared to areas farther north},

Beginning sometime after 2400 BCE, the earliest tablets from Mari, Ebla, and Nagar provide insight into the political and cultural geography of Northern Mesopotamia. About 5000 tablets from Ebla come from an administrative archive that was preserved by the fiery destruction and abandonment of Palace G. The tablets depict a dynamic world, where nearly constant warfare meant unstable frontiers and shifting alliances. At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, a process of regionalization and ruralization began, as the shared traditions of the Chalcolithic gave way to diverse new cultures. Although Northern Mesopotamia in the third millennium was not yet 'Assyria', several elements were already in place that would contribute to later Assyrian political culture.},

First, we apply a summed probability distribution model to the dataset; this model indicates that populations generally increased over the Holocene with a significant rise {$\sim$}800\textendash 600years ago. We then divide our data into 250-year periods and classify each site based on the number of houses, as a large settlement, small settlement, or camp for every period. We observe that the relative numbers of these site types fluctuate through time, and hypothesize that the larger fluctuations indicate changing patterns of social aggregation and dispersal, and settlement abandonment and reoccupation. Through time we see an increase in the number of sites overall, but with considerable variation in the relative number of site types. We see an underlying stability in settlement organization indicative of long-term cultural continuity and place-based identities linked to both specific sites and general locations within the region.},

Nevertheless, the lake has been in a critical situation in recent years due to decreasing surface water and increasing salinity. This study modeled the spatiotemporal changes of Lake Urmia in the period 2000-2013 using the multi-temporal Landsat 5-TM, 7-ETM+ and 8-OLI images. In doing so, the applicability of different satellite-derived indexes including Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Water Ratio Index (WRI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) were investigated for the extraction of surface water from Landsat data. Overall, the NDWI was found superior to other indexes and hence it was used to model the spatiotemporal changes of the lake. In addition, a new approach based on Principal Components of multi-temporal NDWI (NDWI-PCs) was proposed and evaluated for surface water change detection. The results indicate an intense decreasing trend in Lake Urmia surface area in the period 2000-2013, especially between 2010 and 2013 when the lake lost about one third of its surface area compared to the year 2000. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the NDWI-PCs approach for surface water change detection, especially in detecting the changes between two and three different times, simultaneously. \textcopyright{} 2014 by the authors.},

The earliest come from the reign of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III (744-727 BCE), the latest from the time close to the end of the Neo-Assyrian empire in the middle of the seventh century BCE. Quite recently, it has been demonstrated convincingly that authors indeed have to reckon with Aegean mercenaries in the Assyrian army. The Aegean world as an area at the fringes of an empire fits, from a comparative perspective, very well into what authors know about recruitment areas for mercenaries throughout world history.},

  abstract = {This paper promotes an explicit study of archaeologies of empire and environment, and advances theories and methods in environmental archaeology that demonstrate that environmental practices articulate people's relationships to imperial authority. While many studies of empire take for granted that centralized organization and surplus production lead to political control and social inequity, in the papers assembled for this special issue, the very relationship between human-environment interactions and political power becomes the object of study. In this introduction, we review established archaeological approaches to empire, explain how environmental frameworks productively recast our understandings of imperialism, and proffer a number of avenues for continued research on the subject, including those provided by the articles in this issue. We present three overarching themes for the study of empire and environment\textemdash scale, legacy, and resilience and resistance\textemdash and discuss their implementation with the papers that follow. Ultimately, we argue that imperialism entails the management of heterogeneous peoples and environments, and therefore, archaeologies of empire require the integrated study of humans, landscapes, and biota.},

As part of the expansion process into territories of Upper Mesopotamia, Neo-Assyrian rulers (ca. 900\textendash 600 BCE) relied on settled agriculture to produce and promote imperial subjects bound to the authorities for whom they tilled and toiled. However, archaeobotanical data from Tu\v{s}han, a provincial capital of the empire, reveals that people under Neo-Assyria's control did not fully conform to the idealized agrarian lifeways construed by officials to uphold Assyrian power and dictate subject conduct. Evidence for semi-nomadic pastoralism at Tu\v{s}han exposes the slippage between ideal agrarian subject and actual agrarian practice in the Neo-Assyrian empire, wherein lies the contestation over politically oriented subjectivities and their instantiation through land-use.},

  abstract = {The organization of ancient water control and irrigation has been a matter of debate in particular with regard to the role of the state. More often than not a deeply centralized management is assumed, especially for large-scale water control and irrigation systems, despite the lack of empirical evidence. Such assumptions are frequently based on the perception that irrigation and water control requires a massive (though often unquantified) amount of capital investment, labor, and a level of coordination and cooperation which could only be provided and enforced by a central authority. Given that most early civilizations, in particular of the Old World developed in river valleys, allegedly supported such notions of a close correlation between water management and socio-political complexity. More recently, claims about heavy state involvement in ancient irrigation and water management has been called into question, often however without being able to provide evidence for alternative explanations. Reason being that for most relevant cases we lack the necessary empirical evidence to measure the level of state involvement in the management of water and irrigation. The major exception is Mesopotamia with its exceptionally rich archeological and textual record on ancient water control which allows for a more nuanced understanding of the actual role of ancient states in the organization of irrigation and water management. This article reviews this evidence from the sixth till the first millennium B.C. and shows that state involvement in the organization of irrigation and water control within the same environmental context varied considerably over the course of several millennia. I argue for a close correlation between the level of state involvement in irrigation and water management and the way arable land was exploited by state institutions. In addition, I argue that environmental changes at times warranted state interventions out of necessity but also to the ideological concept of rulership as the protector and provider of agricultural profusion.

The avulsion history of the lower course of the rivers Seyhan and Ceyhan during the Holocene remains an unresolved issue. The knowledge about how former river courses have changed is essential for the identification of ancient toponyms with archaeological sites. The analysis of silted up riverbeds based on high-resolution digital elevation models (TanDEM-X) and historic satellite imagery (CORONA) in this paper provide the first indications for the reconstruction of former river channels.

  abstract = {The physical environment of the intertidal zone presents a number of challenges which make traditional surveying methods difficult to implement; whilst the acquisition cost of airborne elevation data can be prohibitive beyond localised applications. Remote sensing data from earth observation satellites has been well established as a method for mapping the extent and elevation profile of the intertidal zone; however the majority of these applications are local in nature, and based on analysis of a limited number of individual image observations. In this paper we outline an automated methodology to model the intertidal extent and topography of the Australian coastline, that leverages a full time series of Landsat observations from 1987 to 2015 managed in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC). Our approach reframes the analysis from time of acquisition into the tidal domain through the use of a continental scale tidal model, combined with a median pixel compositing of Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) stacks, to robustly estimate the tidal extent and elevation profile across the observed tidal range. We demonstrate the ability of a median-based compositing approach to deal effectively with data quality, modelling outliers and other issues that commonly affect single scene methodologies. Our new framework enables us to produce a continental-scale intertidal model, detailing intertidal zone topography at a 25~m spatial scale. We then demonstrate the potential of the modelling framework to derive digital elevation data based on tidal model attribution, validating our models against in-situ GPS observations, before discussing issues that must be addressed to move this capability to a continental scale. The ability of the model to examine coastal stability is introduced, in the context of the conceptual reframing of the data into the tidal domain, with a view to furthering this application in future versions of the model.},

Understanding the topology of urban networks that connect people and places leads to insights into how cities are organized. ÓÅìis paper proposes a statistical approach to determine features of urban road networks that affect accessibility. Statistics of road networks and traffic patterns across 425 U.S. cities show that urban road networks are much less centralized than biological vascular networks. As a result, per capita road capacity is independent of the spatial extent of cities. In contrast, driving distances depend on city area, although not as much as is predicted by a completely centralized model. ÓÅìis intermediate pattern between centralized and decen-tralized extremes may reflect a mixture of different travel behaviors. ÓÅìe approach presented here offers a novel macroscopic perspective on the differences between small and large cities and on how road infrastructure and traffic might change as cities grow.},

  abstract = {In this study, spatiotemporal changes in Lake Burdur from 1987 to 2011 were evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat TM and ETM+ images. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and spectral water indexing, including the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI) and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), were used for extraction of surface water from image data. The spectral and spatial performance of each classifier was compared using Pearson's r, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The accuracies of the SVM and satellite-derived indexes were tested using the RMSE. Overall, SVM followed by the MNDWI, NDWI and AWEI yielded the best result among all the techniques in terms of their spectral and spatial quality. Spatiotemporal changes of the lake based on the applied method reveal an intense decreasing trend in surface area between 1987 and 2011, especially from 1987 to 2000, when the lake lost approximately one fifth of its surface area compared to that in 1987. The results show the effectiveness of SVM and MNDWI-based surface water change detection, particularly in identifying changes between specified time intervals.},

A series of analyses of the Amarna Letters suggests numerous, small, bel- licose "city-states" differing considerably in political prominence and demographic composition. We propose quantitative methods for analyzing archaeological settlement data to explore the spatial configuration of Late Bronze Age polities and their varying hierarchical structures. This approach provides an independent test of the historical method, which identifies capital cities and assumes the adherence of surrounding com- munities, by discerning polities from constellations of settlements, large and small, amid the abundantly available regional survey data for the southern Levant. We infer a political landscape that corresponds well with many aspects of historical recon- struction and propose new ideas on the configuration and structure of Late Bronze Age polities. In particular, the readily apparent balkanization of the southern Levant is founded on significant structural variation between settlement and polities on the Coastal Plain, the Central Hills, and the Jordan Rift. These results carry connotations for the study of earlier and subsequent political dynamics. Our methods and inferences are readily applicable to other cases of emergent political complexity in the southern Levant and elsewhere, particularly those lacking historical documentation.},

The DAAHL project provides a web-based model for researchers from a wide range of fields dealing with cultural heritage to collaborate, discover, and monitor resources. And in an era of rapidly expanding population, urban development, and regional conflict, a system like the DAAHL provides mechanisms to monitor archaeological site conditions over time and lessen the impact on cultural heritage resources through careful planning, and can significantly enhance site preservation and development potential in the Mediterranean basin. Furthermore, it provides a model for archaeological site data management that can be deployed in many regions across the globe.},

  abstract = {Archaeologists have used the rank-size rule, and deviations from it, to explain a number of different processes related to urbanism and social complexity. Frequently, hypotheses have been developed to account for these processes, and they depend on the existence of primate or convex settlement patterns for verification. When the rank-size rule has been used in these cases, most of the time no effort has been made to determine whether the observed settlement system is significantly different than the expected distribution; the two distributions are simply examined and a judgement is made. Some studies have used the Kolomogorov\textendash Smirnov test to verify the statistical significance. The Kolomogorov\textendash Smirnov test is not appropriate for a number of reasons, which will be described in this paper. Here, a Monte-Carlo method is presented; it empirically determines the probability that an observed Kolomogorov value may be equalled or exceeded in a random draw of sites from a population which conforms to the rank-size rule. This method allows statistical significance to be assessed for rank-size studies in settlement archaeology for the first time. Data from a series of Chalcolithic through Middle Bronze IIB/C sites in the Levantine coastal plain are examined with the simulation. The results indicate that, except for the Early Bronze III period, all of the periods examined present significant departures from the rank-size rule. Rank-size plots of the verified distributions indicate the possible existence of a relatively constant rural component in the coastal plain, which exhibits a central-place like distribution. Superimposed on this low-level rural component is a higher level urban distribution, which can be seen to develop, collapse, and redevelop during the periods in question, providing exciting new insights into the nature of Bronze Age urbanism in the Levant.},

Yet, its relation to the structure of the underlying network of human interactions has not been investigated empirically in detail. In this paper, we map society-wide communication networks to the urban areas of two European countries. We show that both the total number of contacts and the total communication activity grow superlinearly with city population size, according to well-defined scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase that affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability that an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains largely unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and scale-invariant acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as cities get bigger, which is numerically confirmed by applying epidemiological models to the studied networks. Our findings should provide a microscopic basis towards understanding the superlinear increase of different socioeconomic quantities with city size, that applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for instance, the creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain contagious diseases.},

  abstract = {In the 9th century BC, Assyrians based in northern Iraq started a relentless process of expansion that within two centuries would see them controlling most of the ancient Near East. Traditional explanations for the decline of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 7th century BC have emphasized the role of military conflict, and especially the destruction of the Assyrian capital, Nineveh, by a coalition of Babylonian and Median forces in 612 BC. However, it remains unclear how the Assyrian state, the most powerful military machine of its age and the largest empire the Old World had ever seen up to that time, declined so quickly. In this paper, we highlight two potential factors which may have had some influence upon the Assyrian decline that have not been previously explored. The first is a major increase in the population of the Assyrian heartland area at the dawn of the 7th century BC, which substantially reduced the drought resilience of the region. The second factor is an episode of severe drought affecting large portions of the Near East during the mid-7th century BC. We propose a series of testable hypotheses which detail how the combination of these two factors may have contributed to the development of considerable economic and political instability within the Assyrian Empire, and argue that these demographic and climatic factors played a significant role in its demise.},

Scott, the compelling tale of Asian peoples who until recently have stemmed the vast tide of state-making to live at arm's length from any organized state society For two thousand years the disparate groups that now reside in Zomia (a mountainous region the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have fled the projects of the organized state societies that surround them-slavery, conscription, taxes, corvee labor, epidemics, and warfare. This book, essentially an "anarchist history," is the first-ever examination of the huge literature on state-making whose author evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion in rugged terrain; agricultural practices that enhance mobility; pliable ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states. In accessible language, James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history, demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and redefines state-making as a form of "internal colonialism." This new perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives of the lowland states. Scott's work on Zomia represents a new way to think of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.},

Path radiance due to aerosols plays an important role over satellite derived reflectance due to higher aerosol optical depth and their seasonal variations. In addition, satellite data from high-resolution sensors are subjected to adjacency effect, which reduces apparent surface contrast by decreasing the top of the atmosphere radiance over bright pixels and increasing the brightness of the dark pixels. In the present study, Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model was used to analyze influence of atmospheric and adjacency affects over two different study areas corresponds to semi arid and tropical forest regions of India using IRS P6 - LISS-IV satellite data. Ground measurements of surface reflectance over selected crops were conducted to compare satellite derived surface reflectance. 6S model has been calibrated for local conditions using measurements on aerosol optical depth, water vapour and ozone parameters derived from MODIS-TERRA and OMI sensors. The methodology was applied for atmospheric correction of satellite data during intense biomass burning episodes in north-east region of India. Results of the study indicated that satellite reflectance measurements correlated well after correcting the satellite data for atmospheric effects using satellite based atmospheric parameters. Statistical information and seperability analysis over different land use categories suggested improved dynamic range and better seperability after atmospheric corrections. The major outcome of study suggested that atmospheric corrections using satellite derived atmospheric parameters provides a reasonably good data set when ground measurements on atmospheric parameters and surface reflectance are not available.},

  abstract = {the academic community. Yet, in some respects, they occupy a selectively inferior niche due to structural constraints, as well as personal and professional limitations. ECRs, who are at an initial stage of their careers, face multiple challenges in research and publishing due to a relative lack of experience. These may make them vulnerable to abuse and cause stress and anxiety. Those challenges may have been amplified in the COVID-19 era. ECRs' efforts may unfairly boost the reputation of their mentors and/or supervisors (Matthew Effect), so greater credit equity is needed in research and publishing. This opinion paper provides a broad appreciation of the struggles that ECRs face in research and publishing. This paper also attempts to identify extraneous factors that might make ECRs professionally more vulnerable in the COVID-19 era than their established seniors. ECRs may find it difficult to establish a unique career path that embraces creativity and accommodates their personal or professional desires. This is because they may encounter a rigid research and publishing environment that is dominated by a structurally determined status quo. The role of ECRs' supervisors is essential in guiding ECRs in a scholarly volatile environment, allowing them to adapt to it. ECRs also need to be conscientious of the constantly evolving research and publishing landscape, the importance of open science and reproducibility, and the risks posed by spam and predatory publishing. Flexibility, sensitivity, creativity, adaptability, courage, good observational skills, and a focus on research and publishing integrity are key aspects that will hold ECRs in good stead on their scientific career path in a post-COVID-19 era.},

Avulsions are primarily features of aggrading floodplains. Their recurrence interval varies widely among the few modern rivers for which such data exist, ranging from as low as 28 years for the Kosi River (India) to up to 1400 years for the Mississippi. Avulsions cause loss of life, property damage, destabilization of shipping and irrigation channels, and even coastal erosion as sediment is temporarily sequestered on the floodplain. They are also the main process that builds alluvial stratigraphy. Their causes remain relatively unknown, but stability analyses of bifurcating channels suggest that thresholds in the relative energy slope and Shields parameter of the bifurcating channel system are key factors.},

This paper focusses on the exclusive use of free remote sensing data by the Western Harra Survey (WHS), an archaeological project investigating the arid ``Black Desert'' of north-eastern Jordan, a largely impenetrable landscape densely strewn with basalt blocks. The systematic analysis of such data by conducting a holistic satellite survey prior to the commencement of fieldwork allowed for the precise planning of ground surveys, with advanced knowledge of which sites were vehicle-accessible and how to efficiently visit a stratified sample of different site types. By subsequently correlating the obtained ground data with this analysis, it was possible to create a typological seriation of the site forms known as ``wheels'', determine that at least two-thirds of sites are within 500 m of valleys or mudflats (highlighting these features' roles as access routes and resource clusters) and identify numerous anthropogenic paths cleared through the basalt for site access and long-distance travel. These results offer new insights into this underrepresented region and allow for supra-regional comparisons with better investigated areas by a method that is rapid and cost-effective.},

The COVID-19 global pandemic has further highlighted the extent of precarity for many working in higher education. It is in this context that we situate this paper, reflecting on how time is experienced for academics in a period of growing uncertainty, and what this means for individuals who work on casual or fixed-term contracts. While previous research has examined how academics experience time, limited attention has been paid to the ways in which time is experienced by those in precarious employment. Drawing on interviews with 24 academics employed on casual or fixed-term contracts, this paper investigates differences between the experiences of time for those in the ?precariat? and those in ongoing employment. We describe social acceleration and uncertainty as inherent features of the neoliberal context of academia. This paper builds on Ylijioki and M\"antyl\"a?s categories of academic time to illustrate how the paid work of precariously employed academics consists primarily of ?scheduled time?. We argue, however, that academics in short-term or casual employment also engage in substantial unpaid work or ?concealed time? in order to compete for future employment. While acknowledging the struggles associated with the acceleration of work for all academics, this paper raises significant concerns about the overwork and risk of burnout for those in precarious employment.},

  abstract = {Estimating groundwater recharge to aquifer systems is a very important element in assessing the water resources of the West Bank. Of particular interest is the sustainable yield of the aquifers. Previous studies have developed analytical recharge models that are based on the long-term annual rainfall data. These models have been shown to be inadequate and changes over shorter periods, e.g. monthly estimates, must be known in order to study the temporal distribution of recharge. The approach used in this research integrates data derived from satellite images (e.g. land cover, evapotranspiration, rainfall, and digital elevation model) with hydrogeological data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) model to identify and map the surface recharge areas. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) is applied to time series of remote sensing MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 3 data of reflectance and surface temperature measurements to estimate monthly evapotranspiration; precipitation is derived from the monthly data sets of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM); runoff is given assumed values of 0.75 mm month-1 and 0.4 mm month-1 for the months of January and February, respectively. Recharge is quantified from November until March by applying the water balance method where evapotranspiration estimates and runoff are subtracted from precipitation. Results show good agreement between data reported in the literature and remote sensing-based analysis. Empirical models that are based on long term rainfall measurements suggest recharge values between 800 and 836 MCM yr-1 while the remote sensing based model results estimate recharge to be 700 MCM yr-1. The Western, North-Eastern, and Eastern Aquifer Basins receive 30\%, 23\%, and 47\% of the total calculated recharge while percentages available in the literature provide 49\%, 22\%, and 29\%, respectively. Discrepancies are mainly due to lack of field data, the overestimation of actual evapotranspiration, and underestimation of TRMM precipitation values. The recharge map indicates that the most effective groundwater recharge zones are located in the north and west of the area that is characterised by thick and well developed soil deposits, heavy vegetation, and a sub-humid climate with the potential of significant recharge occurring during the wet season. Some areas in the east include concentration of drainage and stream flows which increase the ability of to recharge the groundwater system. The least effective areas are in the south and south-west region that is more arid with much less recharge, mainly due to its isolated thin soil deposits. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to demonstrate the impact of land cover change on groundwater and natural recharge. The assessment involved the use of land covers of 1994 and 2004 with the same fixed parameters of evapotranspiration, precipitation, drainage, slope, soil, and geology. Results show a decrease in high and intermediate high recharge areas from 40.25 km2 and 2462.25 km2 in year 1994 to 15.5 km2 and 1994 km2 in 2004, respectively. This illustrates the extent of land cover/land use change influence on recharge and calls for integrated plans and strategies to preserve recharge at least at its current rates.},

In regard to recruitment processes as well as individual career trajectories, gender is often reduced to a barrier for women in making an academic career. In this chapter, we turn our attention towards early career scientists' imaginaries of academia and academic life. How do early career scientists reflect upon their possibility of having an academic career? What do they see as `boosters' and `blockers' when it comes to success in academia, and how are these reflections and experiences imbued with gender? The chapter is based on qualitative interviews with early career scientists (PhD students and postdocs) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The interviewees were purposively selected from departments with different levels of gender balance and gender balance change patterns. The chapter demonstrates the role that gender plays in how early career scientists envisage their future careers, and in particular how professorships are connected to over-work, total job dedication and incompatibility with `having a life'.},

  abstract = {One of the richest and most complex civilizations in ancient America evolved around Lake Titicaca in southern Peru and northern Bolivia. This book is the first comprehensive synthesis of four thousand years of prehistory for the entire Titicaca region. It is a fascinating story of the transition from hunting and gathering to early agriculture, to the formation of the Tiwanaku and Pucara civilizations, and to the double conquest of the region, first by the powerful neighboring Inca in the fifteenth century and a century later by the Spanish Crown. Based on more than fifteen years of field research in Peru and Bolivia, Charles Stanish's book brings together a wide range of ethnographic, historical, and archaeological data, including material that has not yet been published. This landmark work brings the author's intimate knowledge of the ethnography and archaeology in this region to bear on major theoretical concerns in evolutionary anthropology.Stanish provides a broad comparative framework for evaluating how these complex societies developed. After giving an overview of the region's archaeology and cultural history, he discusses the history of archaeological research in the Titicaca Basin, as well as its geography, ecology, and ethnography. He then synthesizes the data from six archaeological periods in the Titicaca Basin within an evolutionary anthropological framework.Titicaca Basin prehistory has long been viewed through the lens of first Inca intellectuals and the Spanish state. This book demonstrates that the ancestors of the Aymara people of the Titicaca Basin rivaled the Incas in wealth, sophistication, and cultural genius. The provocative data and interpretations of this book will also make us think anew about the rise and fall of other civilizations throughout history.},

  abstract = {In this paper we address the question of developing a lightweight and effective workflow for conducting experimental research on modern parallel computer systems in a reproducible way. Our approach builds on two well-known tools (Git and Org-mode) and enables to address, at least partially, issues such as running experiments, provenance tracking, experimental setup reconstruction or replicable analysis. We have been using such a methodology for two years now and it enabled us to recently publish a fully reproducible article [12]. To fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal, we have opened our two year laboratory notebook with all the attached experimental data. This notebook and the underlying Git revision control system enable to illustrate and to better understand the workflow we used.},

Through a synthetic collaboration with archaeologists around the globe, Stephens et al. compiled a comprehensive picture of the trajectory of human land use worldwide during the Holocene (see the Perspective by Roberts). Hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists transformed the face of Earth earlier and to a greater extent than has been widely appreciated, a transformation that was essentially global by 3000 years before the present.Science, this issue p. 897; see also p. 865Environmentally transformative human use of land accelerated with the emergence of agriculture, but the extent, trajectory, and implications of these early changes are not well understood. An empirical global assessment of land use from 10,000 years before the present (yr B.P.) to 1850 CE reveals a planet largely transformed by hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists by 3000 years ago, considerably earlier than the dates in the land-use reconstructions commonly used by Earth scientists. Synthesis of knowledge contributed by more than 250 archaeologists highlighted gaps in archaeological expertise and data quality, which peaked for 2000 yr B.P. and in traditionally studied and wealthier regions. Archaeological reconstruction of global land-use history illuminates the deep roots of Earth's transformation and challenges the emerging Anthropocene paradigm that large-scale anthropogenic global environmental change is mostly a recent phenomenon.},

  abstract = {North Sinai is of significant historical interest primarily because of its role since late prehistoric times as a land bridge between Egypt and the Levant. Access to this region is challenging due to its harsh geography and security concerns. Remote sensing constitutes a convenient method for archaeological prospection and monitoring over such regions with its low cost (relative to ground based sensing techniques), global coverage, and high temporal and spatial sampling. This paper describes part of a study to revisit a number of sites investigated during the North Sinai Survey (1972\textendash 1982) with very high resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite imagery. These were acquired throughout the summer of 2017 in the framework of a European Space Agency research project. The Synthetic Aperture Radar data includes Spotlight and Staring Spotlight modes of the TerraSAR-X mission, while the optical imagery was acquired by the Pleiades mission. The TerraSAR-X data were processed to derive filtered amplitude and consecutive coherence time series. The results of the TerraSAR-X data processing, and the pan-sharpened Pleiades data were compared with the results of the North Sinai Survey to detect possible additional buried structures in the radar data, or newly excavated sites in the optical data. While the analysis is still ongoing, results are reported here of the Qasrawet archaeological site, which was partially investigated by the North Sinai Survey expedition, but assumed to cover a much larger area. Herein, a number of newly excavated structures are apparent in the remote sensing data. The similarity of features in both the TerraSAR-X and Pleiades data suggest that all structures are surface residues, and therefore, that the subsurface mapping capabilities of the TerraSAR-X data in this area are limited. The utility of both data types for archaeological site monitoring are discussed.},

  abstract = {A buried, dark coloured loam soil horizon embedded between calcareous wind blown sand deposits is identified in three areas of the Tofts Ness landscape. The close association with early settlement sites and enhanced total phosophate levels suggests that this soil horizon is anthropogenic in origin. Radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic relationships with settlement sites indicate that the horizon is associated with Bronze Age cultural landscape activity and may have commenced formation during the Late Neolithic period. Horizon formation is interpreted through a synthesis of thin section micromorphology, stable carbon isotope analysis and analysis of free soil lipids. These analytical methods indicate that formation was through the application of grassy turf material together with domestic waste midden, while cultivation was moderately intense as evidenced by the movement of fine material through the horizon. The closest parallels to these soil horizons are the cultural plaggen soils of continental north west Europe, with the Tofts Ness soils amongst the earliest known of these soil types. Application of this manuring technique at Tofts Ness allowed arable activity in what was a highly marginal farming environment; emerging evidence from other parts of the Northern Isles of Scotland suggests that these manuring strategies were commonly used in early arable systems.},

The ACCORD project examines the opportunities and implications of digital visualisation technologies for community engagement and research through the co-creation of 3D models of historic monuments and places. Despite their increasing accessibility, techniques such as laser scanning, 3D modelling and 3D print- ing have remained firmly in the domain of heritage specialists. Expert forms of knowledge and/or professional priorities frame the use of digital visualisation technologies and forms of community-based social value are rarely addressed. Consequently, the resulting digital objects fail to engage communities as a means of researching and representing their heritage. The first part of this paper pres- ents how the ACCORD project seeks to address this gap through the co-design and co-production of an integrated research asset that encompasses social value and engages communities with transformative digital technologies. The second half of this paper (section 4) presents a case study of an ACCORD project based in Argyll which highlights the nature of community relations with expert groups, issues of archaeological authority and the transformative power of co-production using digital recording techniques.},

Archaeological prospection has often focused on L-band SAR sensors, given the ability of longer wavelengths to penetrate more deeply into sand. In contrast, this study demonstrates capabilities of shorter-wavelength, but higher spatial resolution, C-band and X-band SAR sensors in archaeological subsurface imaging at the site of `Uqdat al-Bakrah (Safah), Oman. Despite having varying parameters and acquisitions, both the X-band and C-band images analyzed were able to identify a subsurface paleo-channel that is not visible on the ground surface. This feature was first identified through Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey, then recognized in the SAR imagery and further verified by test excavations. Both the GPR and the excavations reveal the base of the paleo-channel at a depth of 0.6 m\textendash 0.7 m. Hence, both X-band and C-band wavelengths are appropriate for subsurface archaeological prospection in suitable (dry silt and sand) conditions with specific acquisition parameters. Moreover, these results offer important new insights into the paleo-environmental context of ancient metal-working at `Uqdat al-Bakrah and demonstrate surface water flow roughly contemporary with the site's occupation.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing images can be used to delineate variations in the area of lakes and to assess the influence of environmental changes and human activities. However, because lakes are dynamic, results obtained from individual images acquired on a single date are not representative and do not accurately reflect ongoing changes. In this study, we used 8-day moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) composite data from 2000 to 2010 to map water surface changes over 629 lakes in China. We combined automatic extraction of training data and support vector machine classification to derive the spatial distribution of these large water bodies. The producer's and user's accuracies for MODIS images were 91.06 \% and 89.81 \%, respectively, when compared with interpretation results from 30 m resolution Landsat images taken on similar days. Area changes, variability, inundation intensity, and rainy seasons of the 629 lakes were analyzed based on this multi-temporal lake database. The total area of the 629 lakes increased over the study period, primarily as a result of the expansion of lake areas on the Tibetan Plateau. There were 12 lakes with a maximum area {$>$}1,000 km2, and six of these decreased in area from 2000 to 2010. The shrinkages of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake were -54.76 and -25.08 km2/a, respectively. The area of lakes on Tibetan Plateau, in northern Xinjiang, northeastern Inner Mongolia, and northeastern China varied little, while lakes on the Yangtze Plain, in southern Inner Mongolia, and central Xinjiang fluctuated considerably. Inundation intensity increased for lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, in northern Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin, while inundation extent decreased in central Xinjiang, southern Tibet, southern Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and on the Yangtze Plain. This study is an attempt to develop high-frequency specific land cover maps to improve applicability of general land cover maps. The lake products serve as an important supplement to hydrologic data. The lake database enables the generation of new land surface process models, which could improve the precision of simulations, based on more accurate observations of dynamic lake systems.},

  abstract = {Very high-resolution (VHR) optical satellite imagery ({$\leq$}5 m) is nowadays an established source of information to monitor cultural and archaeological heritage that is exposed to hazards and anthropogenic threats to their conservation, whereas few publications specifically investigate the role that regularly acquired images from high-resolution (HR) satellite sensors (5-30 m) may play in this application domain. This paper aims to appraise the potential of the multispectral constellation Sentinel-2 of the European Commission Earth observation programme Copernicus to detect prominent features and changes in heritage sites, during both ordinary times and crisis. We test the 10 m spatial resolution of the 3 visible spectral bands of Sentinel-2 for substantiation of single local events-that is, wall collapses in the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Old City of Aleppo (Syria)-and for hotspot mapping of recurrent incidents-that is, the archaeological looting in the archaeological site of Apamea (Syria). By screening long Sentinel-2 time series consisting of 114 images for Aleppo and 57 images for Apamea, we demonstrate that changes of textural properties and surface reflectance can be logged accurately in time and space and can be associated to events relevant for conservation. VHR imagery from Google Earth was used for the validation and identification of trends occurring prior to the Sentinel-2 launch. We also demonstrate how to exploit the Sentinel-2 short revisiting time (5 days) and large swath (290 km) for multi-temporal tracking of spatial patterns of urban sprawl across the cultural landscape of the World Heritage Site of Cyrene (Libya), and the three coastal ancient Greek sites of Tocra, Ptolemais, and Apollonia in Cyrenaica. With the future development of tailored machine learning approaches of feature extraction and pattern detection, Sentinel-2 can become extremely useful to screen wider regions with short revisiting times and to undertake comparative condition assessment analyses of different heritage sites.},

  abstract = {Background Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers \textendash{} data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

  abstract = {This study demonstrated the capabilities of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data in regional mapping and characterization of inland valley (valley bottoms plus valley slopes or fringes) agroecosystems. A methodology was developed involving image enhancement, display, and digitizing, as well as image and Geographical Information System (GIS) manipulation techniques for rapid studies of inland valley characteristics over large areas. A case study was conducted using Landsat-5 TM data over the regions of Save and Parakou in the Republic of Benin (path:192, row:54 of Landsat TM World Reference System) encompassing about 3.12 x 10(6) ha (study area) to highlight the strengths of the methodology. The results showed the ability of TM data, using the espoused methodology, to map inland valley characteristics: (rr) as well as or better than 1 :200000 topographic maps; and (b) to a significantly similar level to that of 1 :50000 topographic maps. The technique involving a ratio image of TM4/TM7 (red), TM4/TM3 (green), and TM4/TM2 (blue) when displayed in a magnifying factor of one or greater provided the single best enhancement and display technique for mapping inland valley bottoms (see illustrations in figures 4, 5, and 11). A combination of this technique with two other image enhancement techniques, involving a false colour composite (FCC) of TM4 (red), TM3 (green), and TM5 (blue), and a ratio RGB (red-green-blue) image of TM4/TM5, TM4/TM3 and TM4/TM1, improved the results significantly. Relative to 1 : 200000 topographic maps TM data mapped up to 118 per cent stream frequencies (number of streams km(-2)) and 99 per cent stream densities (length of streams km(-2)). However, relative to 1 : 50000 topographic maps TM data mapped only 74 per cent stream frequencies and 77 per cent stream densities. The ability of TM data to provide the shape, size, area, spatial distribution, and land use characteristics of inland valleys (see figure 11, for example), unlike other data sources, such as topographic maps, have been highlighted in this paper. TM-derived valley bottom widths and vegetation characteristics (e.g., Ratio Vegetation Index; RVI) of valley bottoms and valley fringes provided highly positive correlations or formed statistically significant relationships with the corresponding ground-measured information. In the total study area of 3.12 x 10(6) ha, covered by a full Landsat- 5 TM scene (image), there were 9 per cent valley bottoms (see figure 11), and 19.2 per cent valley fringes as mapped using the espoused methodology. Of this, 7.9 per cent of the valley bottoms, and 15.9 per cent of the valley fringes were cultivated. The percentage of inland valleys and their cultivation intensities relative to their distance from the road network and settlements were established. The major road network and a significant proportion of the settlements were also mapped directly from the TM data. These results indicate the strength of the methodology to rapidly map and characterize inland valley agroecosystems at regional level using high- resolution remotely sensed data},

On the other hand, the Assyrian periphery along the Iraqi middle Euphrates \textendash{} ancient region of Su·∏´u \textendash{} is archaeologically less known. The archaeological investigations before the construction of the Haditha Dam revealed many sites datable to the Iron Age, some of which seemed to have a marked military nature. The region was therefore seen as a seat for fortresses of the Assyrian Empire. The present paper, through a preliminary analysis of the material culture of the sites, the settlement pattern using GIS and satellite images, aims to suggest a more multi-faced nature of the settlement in the region.},

  abstract = {Over the last 50 years, countries across North Africa and the Middle East have seen a significant increase in dam construction which, notwithstanding their benefits, have endangered archaeological heritage. Archaeological surveys and salvage excavations have been carried out in threatened areas in the past, but the formation of reservoirs often resulted in the permanent loss of archaeological data. However, in 2018, a sharp fall in the water level of the Mosul Dam reservoir led to the emersion of the archaeological site of Kemune and allowed for its brief and targeted investigation. Reservoir water level change is not unique to the Mosul Dam, but it is a phenomenon affecting most of the artificial lakes of present-day Iraq. However, to know in advance which sites will be exposed due to a decrease in water level can be a challenging task, especially without any previous knowledge, field investigation, or high-resolution satellite image. Nonetheless, by using time-series medium-resolution satellite images, combined to obtain spectral indexes for different years, it is possible to monitor ``patterns'' of emerging archaeological sites from three major Iraqi reservoirs: Mosul, Haditha and Hamrin lake. The Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), generated from annual composites of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, allow us to distinguish between water bodies and other land surfaces. When coupled with a pixel analysis of each image, the index can provide a mean for highlighting whether an archaeological site is submerged or not. Moreover, using a zonal histogram algorithm in QGIS over polygon shapefiles that represent a site surface, it is possible to assess the area of a site that has been exposed over time. The same analyses were carried out on monthly composites for the year 2018, to assess the impact of monthly variation of the water level on the archaeological sites. The results from both analyses have been visually evaluated using medium-resolution true colour images for specific years and locations and with 3 m resolution Planetscope images for 2018. Understanding emersion ``patterns'' of known archaeological sites provides a useful tool for targeted rescue excavation, while also expanding the knowledge of the post-flooding impact on cultural heritage in the regions under study.},

The current extraordinary availability of remotely sensed images makes it now urgent to envision and develop automatic methods that can simplify their inspection and the extraction of relevant information from them, as the quantity of information is no longer manageable by traditional ``human'' visual interpretation. This paper expands on the development of automatic methods for the detection of target landscape features\textemdash represented by field system patterns\textemdash in very high spatial resolution images, within the framework of an archaeological project focused on the landscape engineering embedded in Roman cadasters. The targets of interest consist of a variety of similarly oriented objects of diverse nature (such as roads, drainage channels, etc.) concurring to demark the current landscape organization, which reflects the one imposed by Romans over two millennia ago. The proposed workflow exploits the textural and shape properties of real-world elements forming the field patterns using multiscale analysis of dominant oriented response filters. Trials showed that this approach provides accurate localization of target linear objects and alignments signaled by a wide range of physical entities with very different characteristics.},

  abstract = {In this multi-authored book, senior practitioners and researchers offer an international overview of landscape character approaches for those working in research, policy and practice relating to landscape. Over the last three decades, European practice in landscape has moved from a narrow, if relatively straightforward, focus on natural beauty or scenery to a much broader concept of landscape character constructed through human perception, and transcending any of its individual elements. Methods, tools and techniques have been developed to give practical meaning to this idea of landscape character. The two main methods, Landscape Character Assessment (LCA) and Historic Landscape Characterisation (HLC) were applied first in the United Kingdom, but other methods are in use elsewhere in Europe, and beyond, to achieve similar ends. This book explores why different approaches exist, the extent to which disciplinary or cultural specificities in different countries affect approaches to land management and landscape planning, and highlights areas for reciprocal learning and knowledge transfer. Contributors to the book focus on examples of European countries ? such as Sweden, Turkey and Portugal ? that have adopted and extended UK-style landscape characterisation, but also on countries with their own distinctive approaches that have developed from different conceptual roots, as in Germany, France and the Netherlands. The collection is completed by chapters looking at landscape approaches based on non-European concepts of landscape in North America, Australia and New Zealand. This book has an\&nbsp;introductory price of \^A\textsterling 125/\$205 which will last until 3 months after publication - after this time it will revert to \^A\textsterling 140/\$225.},

  abstract = {Researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that women continue to be underrepresented in publication output in the sciences. This is true even in female-rich fields such as archaeology. Since most gender-related publication studies rely on data from peer-reviewed journals, it would be instructive, though challenging, to also track publication output in non-refereed and professional or industry venues, which tend to be more accessible to those working in extra-academic settings. This comparison is important in fields such as archaeology in which the vast majority (approximately 90\%) of practitioners in the USA work for private sector cultural resource management firms and federal and state agencies. To understand the dynamics of who publishes where, we compiled a new dataset tracking over 40 years of peer-reviewed versus non-peer-reviewed publications that publish articles on the archaeology of California (an American Indian cultural area including southwest Oregon, most of the state of California, and Baja Mexico) and the Great Basin culture area (spanning eight western USA states). Historic gender differences in the publishing output of authors identified as men versus those identified as women were revealed by articles published between 1974 and 2016 in two refereed journals, the Journal of California Anthropology/ Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology and California Archaeology, and in one un-refereed venue, the Society for California Archaeology Proceedings. Although multiple independent measures indicate that women are contributing and active members of the discipline, publishing records yield more variable results. Specifically, while women have historic and increasingly robust levels of participation in the non-peer-reviewed Proceedings, they remain vastly underrepresented in the two peer-reviewed journals, which are widely regarded as more prestigious and influential. We argue that this ``peer review gap'' is influenced by variation in the costs (largely time investment) and benefits of publication for people working in different professional roles (e.g., agency professionals, private/cultural resource management firm personnel, tenure-track faculty, adjunct faculty, etc.). We also argue that these cost and benefit variations may ultimately influence the decisions of people of all genders and backgrounds, but, because of the current structure of our discipline\textemdash including the fact that women and minorities lag in positions where costly peer-reviewed publication is a rewarded and supported activity\textemdash overwhelmingly affect these groups. We recognize that non-refereed publications such as Proceedings provide an important means of bridging the peer review gap and give voice to individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.},

However, since the mid-nineteenth century archaeology and epigraphy have documented the great irrigation schemes of the Neo-Assyrian kings. The inscriptions of Sennacherib in particular refer proudly to his great network of canals, and often describe them in the context of luxurious gardens and parks. The inscriptions make mention of the waters' use for vegetable garden plots and, less frequently, for grain fields above and below Nineveh.},

Our questions now demand a perspective beyond the excavation trench; we have to consider entire landscapes if we want to know about the rise of urbanism, human land use and environmental impacts, and the demographic impacts of states and empires, for example.

The transition from the Early Bronze Age landscape to the Iron Age landscape in the land of Assyria represents a dramatic shift between two particularly clear signature landscapes. The Assyrian Empire developed technological and social means to overcome earlier urban demographic limits but the Assyrian cultural landscape dissolved nonetheless, coincidentally with the political collapse of the empire. The Early Bronze Age model developed to its greatest extent in the second half of the third millennium BCE, but had its origins in durable and nucleated agricultural patterns of settlement that extended back to the fifth millennium BCE.},

Outputs generated with a multitemporal approach are particularly successful for archaeological research, because it is possible to maximize the visibility of archaeological sites, improving their detection. Multispectral imagery from Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Sentinel-2 collections were used and processed, testing their utility for finding unknown ancient settlements in the densely studied area of Northern Mesopotamia. Seventeen new sites were discovered in an already surveyed area of limited size ({$<$}100 km2), showing the potentialities of this method.

Written evidence for the trade, however, only becomes available during the last decades of the 20th century BCE, in the form of texts preserved in the archives of karum Kanis. Judging from the number and variety of texts the Assyrian trade peaked during the reign of Sargon. The main governmental body of Ashur was ``the City'', that is the City Assembly, which took all the important decisions. Nearly all references to the City Assembly concern lawsuits about conflicts between individual citizens, but some decisions concern commercial or economic policy.},

After an introduction to the theoretical concepts involved, we present a state of the art of methodologies applied for reconstructing pathways and movement in ancient landscapes and discuss the various difficulties in using these methods as well as the most important technical hurdles involved. The problems of integrating optimal pathfinding algorithms with `softer' socio-cultural variables are highlighted, as well as the limitations of modelling connections between places using least-cost path techniques. Network analysis reconstruction and analysis approaches are then reviewed as tools to better understand the overall structure of movement and communication in ancient landscapes. It is concluded that, while the potential of current approaches for understanding ancient movement is considerable, improvement is still needed in three main areas: the integration of approaches, sensitivity analysis and validation, and the theoretical underpinning of models of ancient movement.},

The literacy in data and data handling differs for each user group, resulting in different needs and requirements. In addition, the development of cloud-based data systems challenges traditional workflows of all users. In order to tailor new cloud-based data systems for Earth data users, it is of utmost importance to obtain a better understanding of users in terms of the type of data they explore, the applications they need the data for, the way they access and process data, and the challenges they face. This is an indispensable prerequisite to ensure an increased uptake of Big Earth data in the future. In order to get a better insight in the requirements and challenges of users coping with Big Earth data, we run a comprehensive web-based user survey. Our results, inclined to users of Big Earth data in Europe and the North American continent, reveal that a majority of survey respondents still download copies of data onto their local machine and handle and process data locally with a combination of programming and desktop-based software. However, survey respondents are facing severe problems related to the growing data volumes, the data heterogeneity and the limited processing capacities for their demanding applications. Thus, they show a specific interest in using cloud-based data services in the near future but express the need for an easier data discovery and the interoperability of data systems. Based on the survey findings, we draw a set of recommendations to make Big Earth data more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-useable).},

The chief reason for this was the intensive rescue operation mounted by the State Antiquities Organization in the Hamrin basin, where many ancient sites are threatened by a dam now nearing completion. The conspicuous success of this operation, in which foreign excavators were able to take advantage of the generous allocation made by the Iraqi government, will be apparent in the following pages. The amount of work did however make it impossible for Mr. Postgate to prepare a separate report for 1977, since he was in the field at the time. Hence we have to offer a biennial report, covering more than 60 sites.The reports have been collected and edited by Mr. J. N. Postgate and Mr. P. J. Watson, both members of the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq. Our gratitude goes not only to them, but to all the directors and other archaeologists who have generously contributed to the collection. In some cases we have failed to collect a report, and in this case a brief note is included; this, and a certain unevenness in the length of the reports, is an inevitable result of the size of the undertaking, and we wish to apologize to those directors whose sites are not properly covered. The collection is divided into two parts: normal excavations (including three sites in the Haditha dam area), and sites in the Hamrin basin rescue project, each arranged in alphabetical order. We wish to express our gratitude here to Dr. Behnam Abu as-Soof and Sd. Sabah Jasim for their assistance in collecting reports on the Hamrin and Haditha sites respectively, for which they are the overall directors. Information has sometimes been culled from the Organization's journal Al-Athari, and in this case the source is acknowledged at the end of the report. Otherwise the data come from personal visits, written reports submitted by the excavators, and contributions to the Babylon, Assur and Hamrin conference in Baghdad in December 1978.},

Archaeologists often interpret such finds as indicators of rank and hierarchy among Pleistocene hunter-gatherers. Interpretations of this kind are difficult to reconcile with the view, still common in sociobiology, that pre-agricultural societies were typically egalitarian in orientation. Here we develop an alternative model of `Palaeolithic politics', which emphasizes the ability of hunter-gatherers to alternate \textendash{} consciously and deliberately \textendash{} between contrasting modes of political organization, including a variety of hierarchical and egalitarian possibilities. We propose that alternations of this sort were an emergent property of human societies in the highly seasonal environments of the last Ice Age.

Nearest neighbor analysis is found to be much more sensitive in its detection of non-random spatial clustering. It has the advantage of not being particularly limited in application by problems of size or shape of the area under study, although it does require coordinates for each artifact and cannot be applied when only counts per grid unit are known. On the other hand, nearest neighbor analysis encounters considerable problems in defining the artifact clusters on an area and in comparing the distributions of several artifact types. These problems severely limit the utility of nearest neighbor analysis at the moment. Dimensional analysis of variance handles them better.},

  abstract = {Using accumulated cost surfaces and various pathfinding techniques within Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, archaeologists and other spatial scientists have developed increasingly sophisticated models of human movement. Despite their utility, these approaches can be limited because standard GIS software cannot model movement (1) from many origins to many destinations or (2) without specific origins and destinations. Absent these capabilities, it is particularly difficult to model networks of movement over a given tract of land if you are interested in obtaining a more general sense of movement dynamics, not specific site-to-site patterns. In this paper, we present an innovative way of modeling past movement that generates both natural-looking networks and also indicates the degree of traffic that may have existed on any particular segment of those networks. The ``From Everywhere to Everywhere'' (FETE) model generates networks based on topography and landcover without requiring that origin and destination points be supplied in advance. We apply the FETE model to a case from the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, a region that has extensive archaeological and ethnohistoric data sets that serve as a test of the efficacy of our technique. A comparison of the FETE output with known late precolumbian and early colonial movement corridors indicates that the method is effective and should be useful for modeling networks in other areas.},

  abstract = {Least Cost Analysis (LCA) is a geospatially focused quantitative approach that can help archaeologists better understand how people may have moved across a landscape. At its core is the assumption that humans make decisions about movement as fully rational actors with complete knowledge of the landscape, attempting to minimize the cost of that movement as they travel from one location to another. LCA is most often used to construct a small number of hypothetical routes between locations of interest and, when used effectively, can even lead to the creation of entire transportation networks. Desktop GIS software packages, both commercial and open source, make running LCA relatively straightforward, but that does not necessarily mean that the output is informative or accurate. The following tutorial is designed to expose the reader to the foundational steps required to complete an LCA workflow, along with the scientific rationale behind each step and how to avoid potential pitfalls that one might run into along the way. Relevant literature is cited throughout the tutorial in order to provide context for the technical methods that underpin available tools, to suggest various ways that LCA can be used to solve archaeological problems, and to show the art of the possible.          ,              El an\'alisis del menor costo (Least Cost Analysis-LCA) es una herramienta cuantitativa geoespacial, que puede ayudar a los arque\'ologos a entender mucho mejor como las personas pudieron haberse trasladado por un territorio. Su fundamento est\'a basado en el supuesto de que, los seres humanos, como actores, toman decisiones plenamente racionales en torno a su traslado, con conocimiento pleno del terreno, tratando de minimizar el costo del traslado cuando viajan de un lugar a otro. A menudo, el an\'alisis del menor costo se utiliza para generar un n\'umero reducido de rutas hipot\'eticas entre dos puntos de inter\'es y que, de aprovechar su capacidad eficazmente, pueden inclusive derivar en un definici\'on completa de redes de transportaci\'on.

This paper examines the geoarchaeology of hollow way route systems in northern Syria at three scales of analysis: (1) from satellite imagery, at which scale it is possible to examine patterns of hollow ways over very large areas; (2) in the field, where cleaned sections supply ground control and dating evidence for specific features or hollow ways; and (3) using soil micromorphology to investigate the formation processes evident in the hollow way fills. We also use ethnographic analogy to extend the interpretation of the pattern of hollow ways. Finally, we examine the role of these features in the drainage network as well as their contribution to the development of alluvial fills of the Khabur tributaries. The three sections examined demonstrated that the Brak hollow ways were incised into the landscape, probably in the third millennium B.C. or slightly earlier. The fills show evidence of episodic flow and low-energy soil wash with weak soil development over the last 4000 years.},

This paper aims to review evidence from a series of archaeological surveys to illustrate trends in settlement during the 4th and 3rd millennium BC. Reanalysis of survey data from three exemplar regions in the Middle Euphrates demonstrates that by including settlement away from the main Euphrates Valley we get a picture of two main zones of settlement corresponding to agro-ecological zones. In the northern zone, settlements underwent phases of nucleation and dispersal through time, but long-term configurations were relatively stable. In contrast, a southern zone, south of the Sajur Valley, was characterized by rapid colonization and some degree of boom and bust growth of towns, perhaps encouraged by the opportunities afforded by the high risk but high rewards of the 'zone of uncertainty'. Although ecological conditions and climate change played a role in settlement growth and failure, in part by setting the parameters for agro-pastoral production, it is evident that socio-political circumstances, chronic conflict and sheer opportunism were probably key to both the growth and decline of the southern settlements. \textcopyright{} 2012 Council for British Research in the Levant.},

These levees were reported in several previous works. However, they provide different interpretations, as some authors called them the ancient Tigris while others considered them as one of the ancient branches of the Euphrates. However, in the present study, two fieldwork trips have been carried out in this area: first in 1990, when Gibson and Wilkinson were able to record a series of sections by means of the exposed section of the third river drain project, and secondly in 2003 when Jaafar Jotheri conducted fieldwork as part of his PhD study. Archaeological data and radiocarbon dates have been used and integrated with lithological interpretation of the levees. As a result, it seems that the levees were initiated probably as herringbone canals in the fourth millennium BC and they were sustainable over some 4000 to 5000 years. This supports the idea that this type of herringbone canal system is long-lasting and easy to maintain while the massive and extensive canal systems of later periods were difficult to maintain and had a relatively short life.},

The significance of this increase, namely in the scale and number of canals, conduits and qanats, is examined and related to the role of power and the administration of the later territorial empires which date from the first millennium BC and later. We demonstrate that hydraulic systems spread into the rain-fed zone of northern Iraq, Syria and southern Turkey, especially during the past 3000 years.

Although the boundary between mid and late Holocene deposits (ca. 2000 BC) is represented by sedimentary discontinuities in several alluvial sequences, these transitions were not necessarily contemporaneous. In places, ploughwash deposits infilled valleys where sediment delivery had exceeded channel flow during the last 4000-5000y. In the Balikh valley human withdrawal of water for irrigation has depleted flow, thereby weakening that river as a palaeohydrological indicator. The limited lacustrine sequences do not necessarily provide a reliable palaeoclimatic record because they may relate to increased flood frequency from the inflowing rivers, which may, in turn, result from a range of anthropogenic and natural factors. Late Holocene channel fills indicate less perennial flow, higher flow variations, increased erosion, or accelerated aggradation. Such environments appear to have characterized the last 4000-5000 yr during which time the impact of human population on the landscape increased and climatic desiccation, albeit at fluctuating levels, had probably become more pronounced.},

Although trends in settlement were often synchronous between north and south, there was also a marked spatial variability in settlement, with declines in one area being compensated by rises elsewhere. Particularly clear was the existence of a major structural transforma- tion from nucleated centers during the Bronze Age towards dispersed patterns of rural settlement and more extensive lower towns in the Iron Age.},

Emphasis is upon the retrieval of information from surface surveys, and at the same time, the integration of cultural change within both the local environmental context and long-term environmental change. It must be emphasized that the surveys under discussion, collectively called the Sweyhat Survey, were small and rather detailed studies of some 60 sq. km of land around Tell es-Sweyhat, Syria, including thirty sites on the east bank of the Euphrates River; the surveys were conducted in 1974, 1991, and 1992.

Features such as canals, low density "field scatters," smaller sites, ancient roads, and relict river channels enable the boundary between ancient rain-fed cultivation and irrigation to be approximated. By coupling the evidence from such features with archaeological site survey, I suggest that water supply in the Balikh River constrained total settlement, and therefore population, to a limited size. During the phase of nucleated Early and Middle Bronze Age settlement, nodal settlements formed a focus for the limited pattern of irrigation canals. Settlement patterns dispersed during the later Bronze Age and Iron Age, and the landscape started to fill with numerous smaller settlements. In the Hellenistic/Roman period a major canal probably supplied much of the central Balikh Valley with irrigation water. During this phase region-wide canal systems apparently dictated the settlement pattern, which in certain cases spread out into formerly unirrigated areas away from the immediate alluvial plain.},

Such datasets have conventionally been examined side-by-side allowing informative comparisons. With GIS and other computer methods data may now be co-registered and more fully integrated in composite graphics of multidimensional content. Several approaches to data fusion are investigated including mathematical-statistical techniques, GIS, and advanced computer graphics.

Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat-1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality. Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and follow-up with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop\textemdash justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.},

The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built-up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built-up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built-up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built-up land noise over the NDWI.},

Urban surface water is characterized by complex surface continents and small size of water bodies, and the mapping of urban surface water is currently a challenging task. The moderate-resolution remote sensing satellites provide effective ways of monitoring surface water. This study conducts an exploratory evaluation on the performance of the newly available Sentinel-2A multispectral instrument (MSI) imagery for detecting urban surface water. An automatic framework that integrates pixel-level threshold adjustment and object-oriented segmentation is proposed. Based on the automated workflow, different combinations of visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared bands in Sentinel-2 image via different water indices are first compared. Results show that object-level modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI with band 11) and automated water extraction index are feasible in urban surface water mapping for Sentinel-2 MSI imagery. Moreover, comparative results are obtained utilizing optimal MNDWI from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images, respectively. Consequently, Sentinel-2 MSI achieves the kappa coefficient of 0.92, compared with that of 0.83 from Landsat 8 operational land imager.},

Sentinel-2 MSI provides spectral bands with different resolutions, including RGB and Near-Infra-Red (NIR) bands in 10 m and Short-Wavelength InfraRed (SWIR) bands in 20 m, which are closely related to surface water information. It is necessary to define a pan-like band for the Sentinel-2 image sharpening process because of the replacement of the panchromatic band by four high-resolution multi-spectral bands (10 m). This study, which aimed at urban surface water extraction, utilised the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) at 10 m resolution as a high-resolution image to sharpen the 20 m SWIR bands. Then, object-level Modified NDWI (MNDWI) mapping and minimum valley bottom adjustment threshold were applied to extract water maps. The proposed method was compared with the conventional most related band- (between the visible spectrum/NIR and SWIR bands) based and principal component analysis first component-based sharpening. Results show that the proposed NDWI-based MNDWI image exhibits higher separability and is more effective for both classification-level and boundary-level final water maps than traditional approaches.},

In particular, the findings generated through an innovative process mapping methodology suggest that informal institutions do not merely complement and challenge existing formal institutions, but also portend future ones. Formalization of service delivery, however, is complicated by the fact that current informality does not merely stem from residents' coping mechanisms, but also from Lebanese state officials' nascence of how to deal with people who are neither citizens nor residents of UN-administered refugee camps.},

To counteract this phenomenon, archaeologists and cultural heritage experts have relied upon rescue archaeology practices generally limited to fieldwork methodologies, while remote sensing of satellite imagery remains under-considered. To bridge this gap, we build on a multidisciplinary collaboration exploring the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and open access multispectral satellite imagery, for quantifying the archaeological evidence located within a prospective reservoir area before dam construction. Based on previous research by Marchetti (2020) claiming the necessity for ad hoc protocols to document and monitor the impact of dams on cultural heritage, we selected two complementary situations: the planned dam of Halabiyeh in Syria and the under construction Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. These case studies were analyzed with state-of-the-art methodologies to develop a feasible workflow that may contribute to fostering the use of satellite imagery in operational contexts such as those represented by these particular cases, and be replicated by archaeologists in other areas. The workflow is designed to be integrated to ground-truthing methodologies into two dedicated protocols named Pre-Construction Archaeological Risk Assessment (PCARA) and Pre-Flooding Rescue Archaeological Program (PFRAP) which could eventually become a standard procedure for rescue archaeology in dams areas.},

One of the goals of the project was to detect and reconstruct the Roman viability between the Roman cities of Aquileia (Aquileia, Italy) and Singidunum (Belgrade, Serbia), using different sources and methods, one of which is satellite remote sensing. The research project analyzed and combined several data, including images produced by the Sentinel-2 mission, funded by the European Commission Earth Observation Programme Copernicus, in which satellites were launched between 2015 and 2017. These images are freely available for scientific and commercial purposes, and constitute a constantly updated gallery of the whole planet, with a revisit time of five days at the Equator. The technical specifications of the satellites' sensors are particularly suitable for archaeological mapping purposes, and their capacities in this field still need to be fully explored. The project provided a useful testbed for the use of Sentinel-2 images in the archaeological field. The study compares traditional Vegetation Indices with experimental trials on Sentinel images applied to the Srem District in Serbia. The paper also compares the results obtained from the analysis of the Sentinel-2 images with WorldView-2 multispectral images. The obtained results were verified through an archaeological surface survey.},

  abstract = {The medium spatial resolution satellite data from the polar-orbiting Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors provide 10 m to 30 m multi-spectral global coverage with a better than 5-day revisit. There are a number of differences between the sensor data that need to be considered before the data can be used together reliably. Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 data for approximately 10\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 10\textdegree{} of southern Africa acquired in two summer (December and January) and in two winter (June and July) months of 2016 were compared. The data were registered and each orbit projected into 30 m fixed non-overlapping tiles defined in the sinusoidal equal area projection. Only corresponding sensor observations of each 30 m tile pixel that were both not cloudy, shadow, saturated, or cirrus contaminated, and that were acquired within one-day of each other, were compared. Both the Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data were atmospherically corrected using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) and were also corrected to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBAR). Top of atmosphere (TOA), surface reflectance, and NBAR, for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) MSI and OLI bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (from the narrow NIR band for MSI), were compared and their sensor differences quantified by regression analyses. Atmospheric contamination and bi-directional reflectance differences were evident in the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI observations considered. The MSI surface reflectance was greater than the OLI surface reflectance for all the bands except the green, red, and the broad MSI NIR bands, and the MSI surface NDVI was greater than the OLI surface NDVI. This pattern was also found in the NBAR sensor comparisons except for the red bands. Simulated MSI and OLI reflectance derived using the sensor spectral response functions and laboratory spectra showed similar results in the red, NIR and SWIR bands as the real data comparisons. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions of the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI data for the three processing levels had good fits (r2 {$>$} 0.87 for the TOA data comparisons, r2 {$>$} 0.89 for the atmospherically corrected data comparisons, r2 {$>$} 0.90 for the NBAR data comparisons; p-values {$<$} 0.0001). The OLS regression coefficients are provided so that they can be used to help improve the consistency between Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data.},
